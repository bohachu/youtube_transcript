"0.96 summary of finish big by bill birlingham\n4.24 written by lee schullery in quick read\n6.72 narrated\n7.52 by alex smith introduction\n11.2 the truth is that every entrepreneur\n13.519 must make their exit someday\n15.679 it's an absolute certainty in business\n17.52 and it's never too early to begin\n19.039 planning your exit strategy\n20.8 the problem is that many people focus on\n22.64 their journey through the company\n24.08 and fail to discuss how they plan to\n25.76 leave many might even associate exiting\n28.32 as a choice\n29.119 not a necessity even worse they even\n31.679 think of leaving as selling out\n33.84 but as time passes you realize that\n35.92 you're not getting any younger\n37.28 and that you are certainly not going to\n38.64 live forever you realize that you need\n40.64 to orchestrate transitions of ownership\n42.559 and leadership to improve the chances of\n44.48 your company surviving\n45.76 and thriving long after you're gone but\n48.48 how do you go about it\n49.84 where do you even begin what are your\n51.76 options there are so many unknowns that\n54.16 are both frightening and confusing\n56.079 so over the next three years author beau\n58.079 burlingham committed himself to learn\n59.76 more\n61.12 he interviewed hundreds of entrepreneurs\n63.12 who had either exited\n64.32 were in the process of exiting or were\n66.24 getting ready to exit their company\n68.4 through these interviews it became clear\n70.32 that no two exit strategies were\n72.0 alike but it was also clear that some\n74.479 were certainly better than others\n76.4 so what's the difference between a good\n77.84 exit and a bad exit\n79.6 for most entrepreneurs there were four\n81.52 elements of a good exit\n83.439 owners felt they were treated fairly\n85.36 they had a sense of accomplishment\n87.04 they were at peace with what happened\n88.96 and they had discovered a new sense of\n90.479 purpose\n91.04 outside their business so how had the\n93.6 owners with good exits gone about\n95.119 preparing for a day\n96.32 they would leave what were the patterns\n99.119 well burlingham has identified the\n100.88 common characteristics\n102.159 and aims to teach future entrepreneurs\n104.24 the do's and don'ts\n105.28 of planning their exit strategy\n107.439 unfortunately like many entrepreneurs\n109.68 you're probably not ready to think about\n111.2 leaving however\n112.799 the longer you have to craft a good exit\n114.56 strategy the happier you'll be about\n116.64 exiting\n117.759 so keep reading to find out how you can\n119.439 begin crafting your perfect\n121.04 exit chapter 1\n124.399 planning now can improve your business\n127.04 every journey must come to an end\n128.64 and there's no better time than now to\n130.56 begin thinking about your exit\n132.56 in fact planning for your exit strategy\n134.64 can even strengthen your company\n136.48 for instance ray pagano the ceo of the\n138.879 alarm system company video alarm\n140.72 began to seriously think about his life\n142.64 after business as\n143.76 early as 2004 at the time video alarm\n147.04 was 28 years old and well established\n149.36 they were doing 10.4 million dollars in\n151.44 sales\n152.0 with 42 employees so how was he going to\n154.72 leave\n155.599 at first he thought he might someday\n157.28 pass his company down to one of his\n158.64 three children\n159.76 unfortunately that particular solution\n161.92 was not going to happen\n163.599 therefore pagano had to think about\n165.28 selling the business and that same year\n167.68 2004 a competitor approached pagano\n170.319 about selling video alarm\n171.68 and gave him his price after much\n173.92 consideration\n174.8 he decided he could get an even better\n176.64 offer if he made some changes to the\n178.319 business\n179.28 so where should he begin he realized\n181.599 that to prepare for an eventual sale\n183.44 you're going to have to extract yourself\n185.04 from the business you're going to have\n186.72 to bring up your management team\n188.4 give them more responsibility coach them\n190.64 more and let them run the operation\n193.44 in other words pagano had to remake the\n195.36 business so that i could run without him\n197.76 he began by giving everyone in the\n199.2 company a tangible reason to take on\n200.8 more responsibility\n202.0 by giving each employee phantom stock\n204.799 each employee\n205.76 including assembly workers would receive\n207.68 shares that would entitle them to a\n209.599 portion of the sale proceeds if video\n211.599 alarm would ever be sold\n213.44 from there pagano organized meetings to\n215.519 talk about the finances of the company\n217.84 this proved to be a good practice many\n220.159 employees estimated that video alarm\n222.0 sales were in the hundreds of millions\n223.44 of dollars\n224.239 when their sales were actually less than\n225.84 11 million at the time\n228.0 therefore pagano walked his employees\n230.08 through everything\n231.28 income statements balance sheets capital\n233.519 investments taxes and so on\n235.84 additionally he created a suggestion box\n238.0 for comments and questions\n239.519 he even began to write monthly letters\n241.28 to employees families and sent them to\n243.12 their homes\n244.0 many times inviting them to come in and\n245.92 view the products\n247.28 pagano states we truly wanted to involve\n249.519 everyone in the business\n251.04 he began to listen to supervisors and\n252.799 managers as they spoke\n254.08 up about ways to improve the company and\n255.76 address their grievances\n257.68 meanwhile pagano created an incentive\n259.919 program to increase productivity\n261.519 into the company even made critical\n263.12 strategic moves to increase sales\n264.88 to big manufacturers by 2008 the company\n268.16 had improved immensely\n270.0 their performance was up 21 and their\n272.4 sales had hit\n273.28 19.5 million dollars now it was time to\n276.4 start looking for a buyer\n278.32 despite the crumbling economy the\n280.32 selling price came to 45\n282.16 million dollars four times the offer\n284.4 pagano had received\n285.759 just four years prior at this point many\n288.639 employees had forgotten about the stock\n290.32 program pagano had set up\n292.0 so once they signed their papers many\n294.0 were in shock just to see how much they\n295.84 received from the sale\n297.44 assembly workers received as much as\n299.12 forty thousand dollars each\n300.96 in pagano he was liberated his only\n303.759 regret was that he didn't begin the\n305.28 transition sooner\n308.639 chapter 2 ask yourself who what\n311.68 and why while planning your exit\n314.4 strategy for many years is the best way\n316.24 to set yourself up for success\n318.24 many business owners are left with\n319.919 little time to prepare\n321.6 many grow bored and tired others are hit\n324.24 with an offer they can't refuse\n326.16 and others are blindsided by changes in\n328.16 their industry or the economy\n330.639 there are many reasons behind hasty\n332.479 exits but many times\n334.24 hastily planned exits are rarely happy\n336.479 ones\n337.28 these exits tend to be guided by what\n339.36 others want and are simply a reaction to\n341.199 certain events and circumstances\n343.44 this is why it's important to begin\n344.8 planning at the very beginning\n347.28 burlingham suggests that you first\n349.12 clarify in your mind\n350.56 who you are what you want out of your\n352.639 business and why\n354.479 otherwise you won't be able to choose\n356.24 among the possibilities\n357.84 you may not even recognize the\n359.199 possibilities and when you finally do\n361.199 exit you'll have no idea what to do next\n363.6 and when you don't know what you're\n364.56 going to do next that's where you can\n366.319 begin to have real problems\n368.479 for example after the sale of crosscom\n370.72 in november 2004\n372.319 bruce leach didn't have a plan although\n374.8 he remained on the cross coms board\n376.72 he didn't have many day-to-day\n378.16 responsibilities he assumed that if he\n380.639 simply made himself available\n382.16 that work would just come to him\n384.08 unfortunately this didn't happen\n386.8 you see leech went from managing 300\n389.52 employees\n390.16 to suddenly becoming irrelevant nobody\n392.88 needed him anymore and nobody cared\n395.199 people would make comments like must be\n396.96 nice to be retired\n398.479 the problem however was that leach was\n400.479 only in his mid-40s\n401.919 he wasn't ready to be done so he started\n404.479 a search to replace what he'd lost\n406.479 the problem that leech and many others\n408.24 experience is that they fail to plan\n410.0 what comes next\n410.96 and spend years or the rest of a\n412.56 lifetime searching for a purpose\n414.88 one thing birlingham knows for certain\n417.039 by the time you come up with the answers\n418.72 you will no longer have all the options\n420.4 you would have had if you had started\n421.84 asking and answering the questions\n423.599 while you still had a business hence the\n425.599 importance of beginning your search in\n427.12 stage 1 of the exit process\n428.88 if not sooner however it's not simply\n431.68 enough to ask who you are and what you\n433.44 want\n434.16 it's also important to answer why many\n436.8 entrepreneurs get caught up in the\n438.08 superficial answers\n439.28 of who they are and what they want but\n441.52 answering the why\n442.56 forces you to dig deeper and think about\n444.56 how confident you are\n446.479 for instance norm brodsky failed to dig\n448.8 deep into asking himself\n450.4 why he wanted what he did instead he was\n453.28 too focused on what he wanted\n455.28 100 million dollars in sales however he\n458.16 never asked himself\n459.28 why today he'd probably admit that he\n462.24 had a big ego in need of regular\n464.08 feeding and seized every opportunity to\n466.16 prove he's the best at whatever he does\n468.479 unfortunately his determination to reach\n470.639 the 100 million dollar mark\n472.479 led him to make bad decisions ones that\n474.879 forced him to reflect on himself\n476.479 and the reason his company went bankrupt\n478.879 he realized that the stock market crash\n480.879 of october 1987\n482.479 that wiped out much of his business was\n484.479 indeed predictable\n486.56 but why hadn't he foreseen it brodsky\n489.199 simply hadn't been paying attention\n491.199 in the end having a hundred million\n493.039 dollars in sales was meaningless\n494.72 and if he really looked at himself he\n496.4 wouldn't realize that some of his\n497.68 personality traits could be a threat to\n499.44 him\n499.84 and others if he didn't control them\n504.4 chapter 3 the four stages of an exit\n507.759 after you've discovered the why it's\n509.68 time to start crafting your exit\n511.039 strategy\n512.0 but where do you even start the process\n514.399 of exiting can be long and arduous\n516.479 however it's not just about putting in\n518.24 the necessary time to plan\n520.159 it's also about successfully navigating\n522.159 the four stages of the exit process\n524.32 exploratory strategic execution and\n527.279 transition\n528.8 the first stage is the exploratory phase\n531.36 this is where you begin to explore your\n532.959 possibilities and figure out where your\n534.8 priorities lie\n536.32 during this stage you must do the\n538.16 necessary introspective work and decide\n540.24 what you do\n540.88 and don't want in your exit maybe this\n543.36 is coming up with a number\n544.48 or the amount of money you want maybe\n546.64 it's creating a time frame\n548.0 and even deciding if you want to sell or\n549.76 liquidate your company\n551.36 the second stage is the strategic phase\n554.16 this stage requires you to view your\n555.839 company as a product itself\n557.6 not just the deliverer of products and\n559.76 services\n561.12 once you begin to understand that your\n562.56 company is something that can be bought\n564.08 and sold\n564.88 you'll begin to build in the qualities\n566.48 and characteristics it needs to maximize\n568.48 its value\n569.2 and give you the kind of exit you want\n571.68 the third stage is the execution phase\n574.48 this is where you begin the process of\n575.839 getting the deal done depending on the\n577.519 type of exit you're looking for\n579.44 if it's a sale to a third party a\n581.2 management buyout a gift to your\n583.2 children\n583.839 liquidation of assets or any other\n585.839 possible outcome\n587.12 it's time to begin the process of\n588.48 getting it going the final stage\n590.88 is the transition phase this phase\n593.12 begins with completion of the deal\n594.72 and ends with the moment you fully\n596.24 immerse yourself in whatever comes next\n598.64 according to birlingham if you haven't\n600.399 moved on both physically and\n601.76 psychologically to a new venture\n603.6 career redefined role or even retirement\n606.56 then your exit isn't complete\n608.959 every step will look different for every\n610.48 entrepreneur in fact\n612.399 smart entrepreneurs will overlap between\n614.48 the first three stages at times\n616.72 for instance many business owners will\n618.399 go through the process of negotiating a\n620.079 sale\n620.64 and then back out at the last minute\n622.64 this strategy helps business owners take\n624.399 what they've learned\n625.2 and then revise their stage 2 strategic\n627.12 plan accordingly\n628.56 unfortunately many business owners are\n630.56 too busy coping with the challenge of\n632.079 running their company\n633.12 that they don't take the time to prepare\n634.56 themselves and their company\n636.24 for their inevitable departure therefore\n638.88 it's time to determine\n640.079 what you want your transition phase to\n641.6 look like and begin planning\n645.68 chapter 4 liquidate or sell while you\n648.959 may spend years planning the perfect\n650.64 exit\n651.12 it's important to remember that it might\n652.72 not always go as planned\n654.64 you may be thinking that you'll want to\n656.0 sell your company for millions and then\n657.76 live financially independent for the\n659.279 rest of your life\n660.399 that's the dream right unfortunately\n662.8 selling a company is much harder than it\n664.56 seems\n665.36 for example according to the us chamber\n667.36 of commerce 65 to 75 percent of owners\n670.079 who aim to sell their business\n671.6 never even make it to the market the\n673.92 difficulty of selling can be seen\n675.76 when the owners of a bakery struggled to\n677.44 find a suitable buyer\n679.12 he spent money running ads and even more\n681.279 time holding meetings to plan an exit\n683.12 that worked\n684.24 unfortunately the entire process became\n686.56 too overwhelming\n687.519 and the frustrated owner ended up\n689.12 selling the bakery for far less than it\n691.12 was worth\n692.399 you see when a sale is done too hastily\n695.12 then you can end up making mistakes that\n696.8 can haunt you for the rest of your life\n698.8 that's why it's important to plan ahead\n700.399 to ensure that you get what you want\n702.88 perhaps if you own a small business then\n704.8 your best option is liquidation\n707.2 when it comes to owning a small business\n708.959 many times they only exist for the owner\n710.88 to make a living\n711.76 and keep up the lifestyle they enjoy the\n714.399 owner keeps the business running for as\n716.0 long as they can\n716.959 until they've decided it's time to\n718.24 liquidate in order to retire or\n720.0 transition to another business venture\n722.16 in these cases potential buyers are\n723.92 typically limited to family members\n725.76 employees or friends however if you\n728.88 don't have anyone close to you that is\n730.16 willing to buy\n731.04 then it might just be a waste of time\n732.56 trying to look for buyers\n734.24 on the other hand if you truly want to\n736.079 sell your business it's time to start\n737.76 strategizing as soon as possible\n739.92 while you may think that planning an\n741.279 exit five years in advance is too much\n743.44 it pays to start early literally for\n746.48 instance\n747.04 working on making your company more\n748.48 appealing to future buyers can lead to\n750.399 an\n750.639 increase in many areas including\n752.32 customer satisfaction\n753.68 and recurring revenue streams therefore\n756.399 when searching for a potential suitor\n758.079 it's important to take a look at what\n759.36 their goals are moving forward and try\n761.2 to tailor your company to fit their\n762.8 needs\n763.68 in the end they'll see your company has\n765.44 a solid foundation and will be more\n767.12 willing to follow through on a sale\n769.839 one example includes the owner of a\n771.44 lighting company that knew they had to\n773.12 change if they wanted to attract the\n774.48 attention of a potential buyer\n776.399 the buyer was looking for a company that\n778.0 was financially sound\n779.519 one that could be expanded someday so\n781.839 the company worked on doubling sales\n783.36 receipts and modified their company's\n785.12 business model\n786.24 those changes they worked they helped\n788.72 put the lighting company in a good\n790.079 position\n790.72 and the buyer agreed to a sale\n795.2 chapter 5 determine your company value\n798.56 once you've spent your time working on\n800.16 making your business attractive to\n801.44 potential buyers\n802.48 it's time to address some of the major\n804.0 problems you'll likely face\n805.839 for instance would you want a buyer that\n807.6 plans to lay off your employees\n809.36 or buyer that will change your company's\n810.88 values these questions are important to\n813.2 consider when searching for a potential\n814.639 buyer\n815.36 so it's time to begin thinking about\n816.959 what you prioritize as a company\n819.36 for example roxanne bird prioritized\n821.92 friendliness\n822.639 trust and respect her employees knew\n825.04 exactly what was going on in the company\n826.8 and they trusted that roxanne would have\n828.399 their best interest in mind when selling\n830.0 the company\n831.12 unfortunately in the midst of a deal\n832.88 with a potential buyer roxanne\n834.56 discovered the buyer's unethical plans\n836.48 to let go of the employees\n837.839 and liquidate the company's assets in\n840.48 the end\n841.12 roxanne wanted her buyer to continue her\n842.88 legacy and her values did not align with\n845.36 buyers\n846.0 so she decided against selling if you\n848.8 want to sell your company\n850.24 you too will have to decide which values\n852.24 are important to you\n853.36 and how you want your successor to\n854.8 continue the business do you want them\n856.88 to maintain the values you instilled in\n858.48 the company\n859.279 or do you simply want to take the cash\n860.88 and leave however\n862.56 there is another option as well some\n864.8 business owners plan to sell to a\n866.399 strategic buyer\n867.519 or someone who is already the owner of\n869.199 another business\n870.56 these buyers usually place their own\n872.48 managers into a company\n874.0 and keep each business aligned with the\n875.839 same goals principles and strategies\n878.639 so now it's time to begin thinking\n880.639 what's your ideal exit strategy\n883.04 what values do you hope your successor\n884.88 will uphold\n886.16 remember the earlier you plan the higher\n888.639 your chances of creating a positive exit\n890.48 that makes you\n891.36 the employees and the buyer all happy\n896.16 final summary when it comes to exit\n898.639 strategies\n899.36 the earlier you start planning the\n900.959 better when entrepreneurs fail to make a\n903.76 plan\n904.32 they are more likely to make hasty\n905.839 decisions leaving them their families\n908.16 and their employees in bad situations\n910.639 this can result in a seller's regret\n912.639 that has the potential to last a\n914.16 lifetime if you don't take the necessary\n916.24 precautions\n917.519 therefore a good exit strategy requires\n919.68 long-term planning\n920.8 in which you prioritize your wants and\n922.56 needs and determine\n923.839 what you want after the exit as well too\n926.56 many times\n927.279 entrepreneurs sell their company without\n929.12 knowing what to do after the transition\n930.72 period\n931.44 leaving them without purpose and\n933.12 depressed luckily\n934.959 if you create a plan determine your why\n937.44 and figure out what's important to you\n939.199 your exit can be a positive experience\n941.199 for everyone involved\n946.959 did you like this audiobook summary\n949.199
