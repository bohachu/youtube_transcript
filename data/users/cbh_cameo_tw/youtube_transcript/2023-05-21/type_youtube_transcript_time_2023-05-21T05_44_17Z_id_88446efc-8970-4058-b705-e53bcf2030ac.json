other side this is Ryan\n18.21 tantum your host and I hope you enjoy\n20.34 this episode\n24.71 [Music]\n29.66 how's everybody doing today welcome back\n32.31 to the life after business podcast this\n34.32 is Ryan tantum your host today's episode\n37.56 is probably my favorite one so far I've\n40.98 got to interview beau Burlingham who\n43.8 you've probably heard me talk about in\n45.57 some of my earlier episodes if you've\n47.22 been following along absolutely honored\n50.73 to have him on the show he is an author\n52.62 of Finnish big which is one of my\n55.559 favorite books and pretty much started\n57.6 the entire journey that I'm on right now\n58.97 street smarts which is probably the best\n62.159 overall business book I've ever read\n64.05 small giants another great one and then\n67.26 he has two other ones with Jack stack\n70.2 one is the great game of business and\n72.659 the other one is stake in the outcome\n75.89 this interview with Bo we touch on a lot\n78.99 of different stuff it's a little bit\n80.549 longer than the other ones but I\n81.93 absolutely loved it we really get into\n85.86 some really meaty topics about 2/3 of\n89.52 the way so hang tight in there and I\n92.159 hope you love this interview as much as\n94.2 I do\n94.59 without further ado here's my interview\n97.079 with Bo why don't you give our listeners\n100.409 uh a little bit of an excerpt of why you\n103.409 decided to write finish big cuz that was\n105.539 one of the biggest things that intrigued\n106.89 me when you had said you know how you\n108.899 came to the conclusion that it was worth\n111.079 filling a void you know your voice was\n114.439 out to be her because it was a void in\n116.7 the market well you know it was I think\n120.539 I explained this in the introduction it\n122.429 was it was basically you know I'd been\n126.509 at Inc for many years like but when I\n130.649 started working on it I think it was\n132.27 something like 25 years and Inc never\n139.23 really looked at exits never talked\n142.44 about it never wrote about it and in\n146.52 that I think that the magazine sort of\n148.62 reflected its readership because if\n151.14 there's one thing entrepreneurs most\n153.9 entrepreneurs don't like to think about\n155.85 and talk about it's it's the end of the\n158.16 journey it's the exits\n160.14 and so that changed when norm Brodsky\n167.58 you know you know who I do the column\n169.38 within Inc came back from a conference\n173.78 where and told me that he had met\n179.07 somebody private equity firm that was\n181.709 wanted to buy his company and that he'd\n185.01 named a couple of conditions and which\n189.989 he thought might be deal-breakers and\n192.209 yet they didn't have a problem with them\n194.28 at all and so you know I said then maybe\n198.959 we should start writing about this in\n200.61 the magazine and he said sure why not\n203.22 now of course in in the in retrospect\n206.94 there were many reasons why not it was\n209.1 just gonna say that hey I get the fact\n211.32 that he just like John Dunbar without\n212.79 his kind of unique yeah it's very unique\n215.43 and I have to say that the prospective\n219.69 buyers weren't all that thrilled with\n221.69 the decision but we we so we started\n228.69 doing this weekly series in Inc called\n232.35 the offer not weed not weekly monthly\n234.269 series called the offer in which we you\n240.15 know we wrote about exactly what was\n241.98 happening and as close to real time as\n243.989 you can get in a monthly magazine and\n246.6 you know we went through his whole\n249.6 perspective on it and what his emotions\n252.84 were and you know it's very mixed\n256.38 emotions about the possibility of\n259.14 selling this business that he'd spent\n260.85 most of his adult life building and\n264.53 wondering what it was going to be like\n266.58 afterwards and all that and at one point\n271.5 we had asked our readers if they could\n276.15 give him advice about what he should do\n278.85 and we were just flooded with emails\n281.46 almost all of them saying go for it norm\n283.89 you know and in fact he did finally\n291.51 decide yes okay he was going to go\n293.4 through with\n294.0 deal and that was that was a that was a\n299.79 big deal for the magazine and in fact\n303.3 the editor of the magazine decided it\n305.31 was such a big deal that she would put\n308.13 norm on the cover with a cover line\n310.23 saying norm decides to sell and and so\n317.31 that that that was the issue that was\n321.18 coming out and then we still had to do\n323.64 one you know given that the production\n327.03 cycle of magazines is you have to do\n330.33 things sort of been advanced so in any\n333.09 of it right after that came out I a\n336.81 couple of weeks later I called him up\n339.87 and said okay what are we going to do\n341.31 for the next column and he told me well\n344.04 actually I decided not to sell I said\n347.28 norm we just put out on the front cover\n351.06 of the national magazine that you've\n353.13 decided to sell he said well he said and\n356.4 he was I think as shocked as anybody I\n359.4 was certainly shocked but he was shocked\n362.49 that he'd actually made this decision\n364.89 and I asked him what happened you know\n370.08 and he said well\n373.29 there had been some key information that\n375.87 he hadn't been given privy to until the\n381.03 very end namely who was the key\n382.979 decision-maker among the buyers and it\n387.75 turned out to be the the person who he\n390.51 trusted least and there had been all\n393.69 kinds of commitments that have been made\n395.729 as to how his employees would be treated\n399.27 various other things as well and he\n403.35 realized that he he could no longer\n406.44 trust them to fulfill their you know to\n410.64 live up to their promises and so given\n414.57 that situation given that he didn't\n416.46 trust them anymore he didn't want to go\n418.77 forward with the deal so which is\n423.599 amazing\n424.229 sorry why did it start in truck I want\n426.599 to put a little\n427.06 emphasis on this because you know I you\n430.9 know one of the times we tried to sell\n432.639 our business in the oh wait or nine ish\n436.03 time and a lot of people say once the\n438.669 sale train is kind of going they just\n441.13 have pretty much just you know blindly\n443.95 go with it so for him to be on the cover\n446.62 of an ink magazine and read all the trim\n449.889 and pull back is absolutely crazy\n452.2 yeah it was it was it would it was\n456.34 amazing\n457.3 and I think he was actually shocked as\n460.21 well when I talked to him about it it\n462.4 was like you know I I said you know I\n464.62 can't believe he did this and he would\n466.78 say to me well I can't believe I did it\n468.79 either but that's crazy courage because\n472.06 you know that just proves everybody out\n474.729 there that you're not on the cover of a\n476.8 magazine you still can say no right and\n482.37 so anyway we wound up not you know from\n487.03 that point on he did you know wind up\n488.95 selling a majority stake in his business\n490.93 and there was a whole process that\n493.06 happened after that but we didn't write\n494.74 about it in the magazine because I think\n497.74 by that point he realized that that\n499.72 there was a downside to writing in the\n501.88 magazine and so we didn't write about it\n506.14 actually until after it had happened but\n508.33 basically the response that we've gotten\n511.06 from readers while we were doing it made\n514.69 me realize that there was a sort of\n517.24 hunger out there and curiosity among\n521.02 people about well what is this\n522.58 experience like and I did some research\n526.27 online to look and see what was out\n529.03 there and the fact is is that there's\n531.67 little if anything out there that's\n534.16 actually about the experience of going\n536.74 through the exit you know there's a lot\n541.69 of things out there about you know how\n544.089 to make sure that you get the most money\n545.589 and so forth and I'm sure that a lot of\n549.01 that is actually very good and important\n551.709 and helpful to people but there's almost\n554.62 nothing about the experience and so I\n557.47 talked to my publisher about it and\n560.06 he thought it was actually a good thing\n562.28 to do good thing to write about so I we\n567.44 you know we developed an understanding\n569.92 about that I was going to go forward\n572.63 with it and and so I'm there I am and\n577.76 one of the first things I realize is\n580.04 that other than what I knew about norms\n582.65 experience I really didn't know anything\n584.72 about this you know it wasn't something\n587.36 that I'd been aware of before I'd\n591.02 written norm and I had done this series\n593.36 of columns what was the thing that was a\n596.33 specific story or experience or\n598.91 interaction he had with someone that\n600.14 kind of realized how much she didn't\n601.49 know about it no III figured that out\n604.13 pretty quickly on my own\n605.84 [Laughter]\n607.52 and and I realized well look I've got\n611.09 the first thing I have to do is I have\n612.62 to educate myself and I began you know\n616.73 asking people for stories if they could\n621.29 introduce me to people at stories I had\n623.78 a friend who ran a Vista chapter here in\n628.91 the Bay Area and I asked him if he would\n632.66 mind sort of putting out the word to\n635.21 Vista chairs around the country he was\n637.88 very happy to do that and I began\n640.31 hearing from from companies and from\n643.28 vistas shares about companies that I did\n647.6 I would look into because they had good\n649.58 stories and so you know I followed up I\n651.92 did somewhere between a hundred and\n654.23 hundred fifty interviews what Sam what\n658.22 was a favorite one that's hard to say\n663.76 they they were every single one of them\n666.8 was unique every single story was unique\n671.48 and there were there were happy ones and\n675.29 they were not happy once and I I'd have\n680.72 a hard time citing a favorite one there\n684.59 was one that I did which is actually the\n687.38 opening chapter of the book and\n694.15 that one actually did in person I I did\n697.46 a little bit online with ray but in any\n700.49 event I decided that I really wanted to\n702.44 go see him\n703.37 and you know see in person what was\n706.19 going on and was he the one with the\n710.48 security system his company yeah I had\n714.17 the security system through the cameras\n716.72 yes yeah when I went to see him he had\n720.14 he'd he'd sold the company and you know\n722.9 he was on his boat and he took me on a\n727.13 which was sort of his reward that he'd\n729.95 given himself for having done this is a\n732.98 beautiful boat by the way and he was\n738.77 actually sort of sheepish when he sort\n740.84 of showed me around the boat like he was\n742.73 a little embarrassed at how nice it was\n747.16 and Nathan I went to see him and and and\n753.53 you know the thing that really struck me\n755.38 in in his story was that it actually\n762.2 turned out so well for him you know here\n766.46 here he had he had originally gotten an\n769.55 offer and he gone to actually this chair\n773.36 and this that share had said well you\n779.54 know you can probably get a much better\n782.69 offer or if you take some time and make\n785.15 some changes in your business and he\n788.96 decided to take that advice and he did\n792.47 make some significant changes in his\n794.42 business and how he ran his business\n796.36 because up to then he was sort of the\n798.71 typical entrepreneur you know the\n801.38 benevolent dictator and and he really\n806.089 sort of had to change things to get more\n807.86 people involved and you know to really\n813.67 try and implement some best practices\n817.79 and he was he was it was hard it was\n821.21 hard because part of that involves\n823.67 letting people voice\n827.27 what everything that they sort of felt\n830.38 in every way that they'd felt he was\n833.54 falling short and he had to sort of sit\n837.08 there and listen to it and and and try\n840.05 to understand it you know figure out\n842.87 what to do about it and so that took a\n847.46 lot of courage in his part do you think\n849.59 do you think that it takes and we can\n853.01 because I think you got a specified this\n855.2 in your book a little bit but do you\n856.19 think it takes an LOI or a random offer\n859.28 or something to awaken the owner to have\n865.25 or accept this feedback or kind of\n867.53 change their direction for some people\n872.33 yes there are you know it depends a lot\n880.37 on the individual but Ray was somebody\n883.04 who'd been going on it was getting along\n885.32 in years and he knew he it don't he'd\n888.5 reached an age where it had dawned on\n890.45 him that he was not in fact going to\n892.22 live forever and he also had a son with\n897.26 some serious disabilities and he wanted\n901.97 to spend more time with him and he was\n906.74 thinking about the things that he wanted\n909.32 to do with the rest of his life and when\n912.86 this offer came along it was like well\n916.4 you know I really I really ought to pay\n919.64 attention to this I mean if he if he'd\n922.37 had that all for 20 years earlier 15\n925.64 years earlier he might not have paid\n927.35 attention to it know so kind of more the\n929.39 timing and the lifecycle of the person\n931.67 and the business and a lot of other\n933.23 accommodations combined huh yes exactly\n936.02 and and and and the thing also that\n941.93 struck me was I mean he'd made some one\n945.89 of the changes that he'd made was to set\n947.84 up sort of a phantom equity system in\n953.03 his company so that the employees would\n957.5 all you know benefit from whatever sale\n961.22 happened now his employees didn't know\n963.29 what to make of this most of most of\n965.84 them you know just I talked to some of\n969.2 them and they they all said that it was\n972.23 just sort of a little weird because this\n974.27 was in contrast to the way that he had\n977.0 run the company up until then but in\n980.57 fact he he did change his whole\n983.42 management style and people saw that and\n987.34 people's responsibilities changed and\n990.5 there were other things that happened\n992.93 that you know were fortuitous in terms\n996.62 of improving the value of the company in\n999.86 any event he worked on this for four\n1003.49 years before he you know was felt he was\n1009.61 really ready to sell and in in the end\n1013.45 he got a significant multiple of what\n1017.95 the original offer had been I think it\n1020.74 was four times with the original offer\n1023.05 holy buckets four and four years and\n1025.93 four times and so that's a pretty good\n1027.31 return it was pretty good and and partly\n1030.67 it has to do with what he had done the\n1032.86 company and partly it had to do with his\n1035.29 timing you know because things had\n1037.9 changed in the in the wider world and it\n1043.48 happened to be he happened to you know\n1048.22 wind up selling at a point where you\n1052.09 know the market was very good for a\n1054.07 company like his and but you can never\n1057.64 always foresee it's kind of just much\n1059.44 more luck of the draw than anything\n1060.7 right well yeah one of the things I\n1064.24 wanted to ask you about because you know\n1066.58 a lot of advisers or professionals or\n1070.33 other business people our owners when\n1072.64 they're on the golf course everybody\n1073.75 focuses on the multiple or how much they\n1075.82 got except you right I mean and one of\n1077.77 the the biggest things that my dad and I\n1080.26 related to and like you said I saw\n1083.56 myself in your book was that it isn't\n1086.5 all about the money and there is a lot\n1088.21 of other things that\n1089.59 you know the owners have to do to quote\n1091.659 unquote finish big so can you get it\n1093.85 give us a little bit of a rundown\n1095.5 well her listeners that was one of the\n1098.529 things about Ray Pagano because you know\n1101.59 when I had look when I sat down to write\n1104.26 and by then I'd done lots and lots of\n1106.539 interviews I wanted to open with\n1108.94 somebody who'd actually had a good exit\n1111.419 and and one of the things about Ray that\n1116.049 made his exit a good exit was that he\n1121.63 was very proud of the fact that whenever\n1124.809 he went back to the company his his\n1127.96 former employees were very welcoming and\n1131.23 had very warm feelings toward him and\n1134.559 you know really totally welcomed him and\n1138.13 and you know obviously wishing him well\n1140.679 and they had good feelings about about\n1144.49 it and for him that was a very\n1146.23 significant thing it doesn't always\n1149.649 happen that way\n1150.88 and but it was very important for him in\n1154.39 that it gave him and what I don't even\n1157.27 think he appreciated how important it\n1159.64 was because it gave him peace of mind\n1162.809 about what had happened to the other\n1165.01 people who had been on the journey with\n1166.779 him and when I actually sat down you\n1169.6 know I I would say when I began my\n1171.789 interviews the the most striking thing\n1174.6 was that I began running into lots of\n1177.669 people who were very very unhappy I mean\n1181.09 I would say that it was about half and\n1183.88 half in terms of people that I\n1185.44 interviewed although other people who\n1187.63 have more experience in this area than I\n1190.6 do say it's more like 70/30\n1192.85 it's the 70 percent are unhappy\n1195.34 afterwards and and and you know when I\n1201.669 found that I said well that's obviously\n1204.159 the book I need to write what's the\n1205.809 difference between the ones who wind up\n1207.46 having the ones who wind up unhappy and\n1212.01 so that's what I was and one of the\n1215.5 things I had to do once I decided that\n1217.899 was the book I needed to write I had to\n1222.37 ask myself well what\n1223.42 I mean by a happy accident mm-hmm I came\n1226.39 up with you know for when I looked at\n1229.18 the people who had the the people I've\n1232.93 interviewed I I realized that there were\n1237.48 at least four characteristics of a good\n1241.99 exit and for some people there was a\n1245.92 fifth one as well the first one was that\n1248.5 they felt that the process had gone you\n1251.23 know they'd been through a fair process\n1252.82 and they gun got in a reasonable reward\n1256.96 for the work that they put into building\n1259.81 the business the the second the second\n1265.03 factor was that they had they could look\n1270.49 back on what they had done and feel\n1274.95 pride in knowing that they had actually\n1279.07 built something of value that it\n1280.78 contributed something positive to the\n1282.94 world and that they could feel pride\n1285.31 about what they had done the the\n1287.89 feelings were not colored by you know\n1291.19 other things and then the third\n1294.58 characteristic was that and it was very\n1300.61 important was that they were at peace\n1303.43 with what had happened to the other\n1305.92 people who had been on the voyage with\n1308.62 them and since nobody built a company at\n1314.26 least a sellable company on their own\n1316.26 and and and I and I could see that a lot\n1322.15 of people were very very troubled\n1324.04 afterwards by what had happened to their\n1326.56 former employees or partners or their\n1329.59 customers and then the fourth\n1333.82 characteristic was that they'd found\n1336.34 something afterwards that they could\n1338.62 really become engaged in and it you know\n1343.69 that that something that they could do\n1347.13 afterwards that was you know gave them a\n1351.13 life after the business as opposed as\n1354.91 opposed to sort of drifting around\n1357.19 not sure what to do or who they were\n1359.95 anymore which happened with some people\n1362.77 so that was the fourth cat and a very\n1365.14 important one this the fist was which\n1368.11 wasn't true of everybody but it was true\n1370.15 of some people was that they could look\n1372.67 back at look that their companies were\n1375.73 going on without them\n1377.2 and in doing and doing well which sort\n1381.16 of gave them a sense of a legacy that\n1384.19 they'd actually build something that\n1386.32 could last after them those and I found\n1390.37 that those four or five qualities were a\n1398.37 defined for almost everybody what what a\n1402.13 good exit was if you were missing just\n1404.65 one of them you can have a you would you\n1408.58 could have a very bad exit I'm you know\n1411.34 if you felt that you know the process\n1414.22 hadn't been fair and you wound up\n1415.99 getting screwed well you'd be upset\n1417.97 about that if you if you were so\n1421.18 conflicted about what was happening that\n1423.67 you couldn't look back with pride on\n1425.94 what he'd done before that that could\n1429.04 ruin everything for you if you're well\n1432.64 if your employees were getting screwed\n1434.55 afterwards that would be a something\n1438.07 that would make you very unhappy\n1440.14 and if you weren't able to figure out\n1443.56 what to do afterwards that was a very\n1446.02 common one and you know who could could\n1452.14 make for a very unhappy exit and for\n1455.38 some people if if their customers were\n1458.22 we're not what they had\n1461.47 oh if they're if they're companies you\n1466.45 know either went out of business or\n1468.73 we're not doing as well as they would\n1472.15 have liked then that could make for an\n1474.07 unhappy aggregate well I just think is\n1476.89 you know you're four to five\n1478.57 characteristics you know what I see in a\n1480.97 lot of them is you know all the owners\n1483.88 that I know and all the reason that I\n1486.19 started my business or my\n1487.62 dad or anybody that I've talked to it's\n1489.36 you you start your company for freedom\n1492.059 and control right and so alright there's\n1495.6 such as an incent\n1496.89 a crazy sense of making sure that you're\n1500.64 always trying to predict or envision the\n1502.89 future and then trying to control\n1504.63 whatever chaos that you've got in front\n1506.52 of you and you know all of those\n1508.82 characteristics are showing that they\n1511.08 either didn't envision something that\n1512.73 they saw coming or it wasn't on their\n1514.8 terms because they weren't able to\n1516.03 essentially quarterback it and there's\n1518.46 so many so many variables when you're\n1520.53 doing the exit that it's you know hard\n1522.51 to be they don't do this all the time I\n1524.46 think you said that in your book a\n1525.54 couple times yeah\n1527.1 well yes well that's that's that's very\n1532.14 true Ryan and I think that you know then\n1535.679 when I actually looked at the specifics\n1537.99 of how people would have been what\n1542.4 people who had had a be happy exits had\n1545.61 done in order to wind up with those you\n1549.57 know four or five characteristics you\n1554.58 know one of them for sure was that in\n1558.99 fact many ways the most important one\n1561.21 was that they given themselves enough\n1563.04 time to go through the entire process a\n1566.1 lot of people you know went into it and\n1570.69 became and we're actually totally\n1573.03 unprepared for what lay ahead of them\n1575.61 and and because they hadn't given\n1579.75 themselves enough time and they hadn't\n1582.45 actually gone through the whole process\n1586.41 I mean that's a whole other issue\n1588.0 because that really forced me even\n1591.63 though I've been an incan written about\n1593.37 lots of lots of entrepreneurs and met\n1595.53 lots of lots of entrepreneurs it was\n1598.41 sort of a revelation to me that the\n1602.34 whole way that I had thought about the\n1605.63 process that you go through when you\n1608.309 start or you buy a company and that I\n1613.17 had sort of the wrong idea about it and\n1615.69 the whole way that I looked at an exit I\n1617.7 had the wrong idea about that too\n1620.62 and I had to really revise those and and\n1625.69 once she I mean I can talk about how I\n1629.98 revised them I mean one of the things I\n1633.76 realized that was that when we talk\n1636.88 about building companies that's exactly\n1639.64 the way we put it the process is about\n1643.39 building a company which is you know as\n1648.34 if it's sort of a construction project\n1650.1 the goal of which is to wind up with a\n1652.84 great company at the end and what I\n1656.169 realized was that when you start or you\n1658.539 buy a company become an owner that in\n1661.6 fact you know it's not a construction\n1665.169 process it's a journey and like every\n1668.2 journey it has a beginning a middle and\n1669.909 an end and the end isn't when you build\n1673.299 that company the end is when you leave\n1675.37 that company and that that required you\n1679.24 to sort of think about the whole process\n1680.89 in a different way\n1683.529 a way that many people aren't aware of\n1687.61 and aren't thinking about what they're\n1690.76 doing when most people are not thinking\n1694.029 but most people are focused on let's see\n1697.33 if we can build something that will be\n1699.789 viable and that will you know allow me\n1703.09 to they think about what will happen if\n1708.76 they think about wanting to just to\n1711.039 start a company that's going to succeed\n1713.289 in the sense that it will allow them\n1716.23 provide them with an independent source\n1718.539 of income and it's kind of going back go\n1722.59 max your construction process like look\n1724.48 when do you stop building like when it\n1726.52 when do you like open the front door and\n1728.71 get to live in it right right exactly\n1731.2 and go ahead yeah and and and so that\n1735.61 was one of the big revelations to me was\n1738.19 that the whole way we think about the\n1741.58 process if an entrepreneur goes through\n1744.1 was was flawed or at least the way I was\n1748.39 thinking about it was a flawed you know\n1750.19 it's interesting I\n1751.58 talk to this gentleman he was actually\n1752.87 on my podcast a couple of interviews ago\n1755.51 and he told me that he goes it's kind of\n1758.48 like you know your your parents are\n1760.55 telling you how to live your life and\n1762.11 you're like yup yup yup yup bite you\n1764.06 know you'll understand when you have\n1765.14 kids and then all of a sudden you have\n1767.63 kids and you're like I get it yeah right\n1770.81 he said it's just like that word until\n1773.36 you've sold your company you don't\n1774.65 really understand you can have all these\n1776.9 people tell you it but you don't really\n1778.31 get that that's that completes the\n1780.17 journey on that one\n1781.37 spectrum right exactly so I get in y'all\n1785.75 go ahead no go ahead you go ahead I got\n1788.27 an interesting question for you both\n1789.44 because your few books that you know the\n1793.28 finished big street smarts small giants\n1795.74 and the great game of business I like\n1797.06 some of my absolutely favorite business\n1799.25 books and the one thing that I keep\n1801.77 going back to because you know it kind\n1804.74 of revolves around that number four and\n1807.77 the title of this podcast of life after\n1809.84 business is how and actually what ally\n1813.47 and Andrew do it orange Q is the the\n1815.63 there's so much role identity fusion\n1818.18 with the business owner and their\n1820.01 company right and you you had mentioned\n1823.28 it a lot in small giants where you know\n1825.68 you're talking about these companies\n1827.33 that are just beautifully healthy and\n1829.22 their cultures and their communities and\n1830.99 how what it takes to be a small giant\n1833.24 and you you constantly go back to odd it\n1837.11 I'm wondering can you be a small giant\n1839.21 and finish big and I'm hoping you can\n1841.55 say yes and I believe that you will but\n1843.68 the reason I want to ask that question\n1845.63 and bow is because I see entrepreneurs\n1848.3 is as artists right where you got like\n1850.97 I'm building a brace right now and my\n1852.77 dad did and the people that I hire\n1855.41 reflect me how I get my customers\n1857.75 reflects me everything is essentially me\n1860.51 you know throughout the business and so\n1863.0 how can you step away and then start to\n1866.6 look at your business like an investment\n1868.4 vehicle which you had mentioned that Jon\n1870.38 Warlow does a fantastic job at that and\n1872.36 how can you have both you know how can\n1874.7 you go in and love and have the passion\n1877.19 for your company like you want to and\n1879.1 have a small giant and\n1881.6 finish big is that well you put your\n1884.09 finger on something that is very of\n1887.419 great interest to me actually because I\n1890.78 have to say that when I the writing\n1893.09 finish big was one of the most\n1894.71 educational experiences I've ever been\n1897.559 through as a journalist because I found\n1901.34 out so many things about\n1903.28 entrepreneurship that they didn't\n1904.82 understand before and you know basically\n1910.21 the the people who build small Giants\n1913.88 face the same challenge that everybody\n1916.76 else does I mean every entrepreneur\n1919.4 exits their business you know they may\n1921.799 exit feet-first but they're going to\n1923.84 leave one way or another and I did have\n1927.049 a chapter in small giants where I talked\n1929.99 about how you know in fact most of the\n1933.559 companies that I had written about were\n1937.52 not prepared for what was going to\n1940.039 happen and you know by writing for after\n1948.74 I'd written finish big you know I went\n1951.65 back and thought about all those because\n1953.51 I actually knew addition of small giants\n1955.909 just came out with with two new chapters\n1959.32 yeah I write I recently reread it and\n1961.909 it's interesting because you went back\n1963.919 and visited some of Omaha yeah right and\n1966.73 things had happened you know it was a\n1969.049 very ten years was a very eventful ten\n1974.72 years we went through the Great\n1976.28 Recession among other things and\n1978.2 obviously that affected everybody and\n1981.85 but it also got me to think about you\n1985.429 know this question that you just raised\n1987.26 namely how does this what I learned in\n1991.309 finish big in writing finish big how did\n1994.429 that affect the you know company that is\n1998.63 basically you know aiming to create this\n2003.52 sort of a great company I mean is that\n2007.15 great company going to I mean a lot of\n2009.309 people ask me when I went out talking\n2011.11 about small giants you know that almost\n2014.65 every time I\n2015.49 poke somebody would raise their hand and\n2017.77 say you know it's you know they they\n2021.01 love the stories that I told they said\n2023.8 it sounds like that the the leader is\n2028.559 extremely important right is is are\n2034.27 these companies capable of remaining\n2036.61 great after that leader isn't around\n2039.49 anymore\n2040.36 and it was a really good question that\n2042.52 people were asking me and you know I\n2045.55 answered it honestly which is you know\n2049.179 not necessarily the company's it's so\n2055.03 crazy because I under percent agree with\n2058.179 you and you know there are some of the\n2060.19 stories you know it's it's funny because\n2062.169 you go back and forth you you want the\n2063.58 you know then John warlow's iki drivers\n2065.71 you want to make sure you're not the hub\n2067.0 of the spoke but then you go to norm\n2068.5 brat skiing in City storage and he was\n2071.47 calling customers and that's why you\n2073.179 know it was his personality throughout\n2075.399 his whole company that allowed it to\n2077.409 become what it is and so I mean I look\n2080.47 at what my dad's business you know\n2082.869 started shaking in heaven the the wheels\n2084.94 kind of Rumble is when he disappeared\n2087.58 you know and right how do you take and\n2090.429 take that charisma and the personality\n2091.78 and breathe it into the business and\n2094.3 then walk away\n2095.02 I just don't know well when I will say\n2098.08 this is that when I was writing finished\n2101.859 big I made it a point of trying to find\n2106.8 businesses that had exceptional cultures\n2110.79 like the small giants and that had\n2113.77 managed to remain those to retain those\n2117.54 exceptional cultures through at least\n2120.04 two changes of ownership and leadership\n2125.31 in other words I could see how I could\n2128.71 find companies that it had succeeded in\n2131.619 doing it through one change but to do it\n2134.32 through two changes that really so that\n2136.93 because the second time it's going to be\n2140.31 very far removed from the founder and\n2143.83 you know is it is it going to remain an\n2147.369 exceptional company\n2149.41 second time and you know the fact is is\n2152.2 that the only companies I could find\n2153.85 where that was the case were either\n2156.46 family businesses or employee owned\n2158.83 businesses and you know when I thought\n2163.78 about it I realized that well that's\n2165.52 probably because the culture sort of\n2168.73 needs a garden needs Guardians and in\n2171.76 one case the guardians of the family in\n2174.58 the other case the Guardians are the\n2176.59 employees I will say this is that one of\n2180.7 the things when I talk to companies to\n2183.13 small giants or people who aspire to be\n2186.22 small giants the way I talk to them has\n2190.0 changed as a result of writing finish\n2192.97 big one of the things I say to them is\n2196.86 there are questions that you need to ask\n2199.3 yourself early on like are you building\n2203.74 a company it's going to last after you\n2206.94 or is that something you care about if\n2211.39 it is if you're building a company that\n2214.0 you want to make into a great company\n2215.71 and you want it to remain great after\n2217.9 you're gone there's a whole process that\n2221.14 you have to go through which is\n2223.8 extremely difficult but and it's\n2227.5 extremely important to begin thinking\n2229.42 about it at a very early stage of the\n2231.61 business the person who is it attack\n2234.37 that best at you know who I write about\n2236.35 and finish big is my friend Jack stack\n2238.99 at SRC Holdings he's reaching a point\n2242.98 right now where he's already sort of\n2245.92 told the company approximately when he's\n2248.86 leaving it's not just him it's the other\n2251.86 people in the company and there are many\n2254.14 key people in the company who were his\n2256.03 age and they will all be moving on\n2258.7 around the same time and you know so to\n2262.06 prepare for that there are all kinds of\n2264.7 things he has had to do and he's\n2266.95 basically taking him I mean I've known\n2269.08 him for you know 30 years and has taken\n2271.72 him he's been working on it for 30 years\n2277.44 to try to get to that point and I think\n2280.87 he's got a good shot at it actually\n2282.91 right now but in in in watching what he\n2288.4 has done to try to prepare for this and\n2291.16 to try to prepare the company for it has\n2294.28 really made me appreciate what a\n2298.69 difficult process that is I you know I\n2301.78 say to people the most challenging thing\n2306.88 in business is not you know I was sort\n2309.52 of was to build a great company but I\n2312.88 now realized that the most challenging\n2314.74 thing in business is to build a great\n2317.289 company that remains great after you're\n2319.809 gone yeah that's what sums it up doesn't\n2323.71 it yeah yeah so what do you think is the\n2327.46 most challenging is it is it I mean the\n2330.52 emotional piece of it right because I\n2332.47 mean I there's so many financially\n2334.27 driven entrepreneurs out there right and\n2336.339 once they know where to focus on the\n2339.789 financial piece or their customer\n2341.349 concentration all that is very tactical\n2343.48 right is there anything whether it's\n2346.42 Jack or norm or some of these guys that\n2348.309 you her gals that you've talked to that\n2350.13 what have they done on the emotional\n2352.27 side to help their bridge debt or make\n2356.589 that journey easier well norm you know\n2360.7 he specifically did not you know it for\n2365.26 him it if he was not building something\n2367.69 that he wanted to go on the same way as\n2372.069 he'd run it after him that that that\n2375.46 what his hope you know he thought about\n2379.029 it and his hope was that the people who\n2382.18 had worked at City storage would would\n2385.66 have learned things and taken things\n2388.21 that they could then take to other\n2390.609 companies where they went afterwards but\n2393.069 basically he didn't feel that he was\n2395.95 building a company that was going to\n2398.02 last indefinitely and be run the way you\n2402.13 know and have the same kind of culture\n2403.99 in the same way of doing business that\n2408.539 he'd had that you know that had been\n2411.549 when he was running it Jack is is\n2415.96 different\n2416.71 in that basically his idea along was to\n2421.63 give the next generation the kind of\n2424.66 opportunities that he'd had and that\n2428.02 meant a lot asking people what they\n2431.829 wanted you know that there were choices\n2434.319 along the way did they want to go public\n2436.359 I was a possibility did they want to\n2441.18 sell parts of the business to a private\n2447.099 equity firm that those were\n2448.93 possibilities along the way and you know\n2451.66 he just made sure that he just kept sort\n2454.9 of throwing it back at the employees and\n2457.619 asking them and you know supporting\n2460.18 together groups that would they would\n2462.19 actually ponder these questions about\n2464.17 what did they want to do and the answer\n2466.839 that always came back to him over and\n2470.41 over again was well we sort of like what\n2473.349 we've got right now and we'd like to\n2474.91 keep it going and so that message was\n2479.77 very clear to him and he said okay you\n2483.16 know he was going to focus on trying to\n2486.42 set up the system that was able to last\n2491.829 beyond him and one of the things that he\n2494.41 said I mean because I had many\n2496.27 discussions with him about this I asked\n2500.71 him is it possible for a very\n2503.829 people-oriented culture to last beyond\n2507.73 the individuals who created it and his\n2511.809 answer was that he felt the answer was\n2515.349 yes if you had a hard culture as opposed\n2519.19 to a soft culture and what he meant by\n2522.49 that was it when he meant a soft culture\n2525.19 he said a culture that is totally\n2526.96 dependent on the you know the good the\n2531.01 goodwill and fatherly instincts of the\n2533.71 person at the top he doesn't feel that\n2536.02 that is capable of going on if on the\n2539.92 other hand you actually have a system a\n2542.26 way of running the company that leads to\n2546.549 that creates the culture that that well\n2549.43 that's different\n2550.63 that does have the potential to go on\n2554.2 and you know that's where he's focused\n2555.94 is his attention you know from the very\n2558.789 beginning which was building as he puts\n2563.019 it a business of business people people\n2566.5 who you know who know how to run a\n2570.579 business and who can make the difficult\n2573.009 business decisions that has to be made\n2575.68 they aren't exclusively depending on him\n2579.579 to make those decisions in many cases\n2582.849 they're making those decisions\n2584.049 themselves obviously he's one of them so\n2586.45 he's helping to make those decisions but\n2589.75 you know he's he's very focused on\n2593.619 making sure that he's not the only one\n2596.23 involved in that there are other people\n2598.799 like what Jack did I mean was way ahead\n2602.049 of its time because needed like pretty\n2603.46 much the father of open book open book\n2605.319 management and what I what I loved about\n2607.839 your guy's book was I mean in what he\n2610.599 did was call on everybody else like hey\n2613.269 guys we're all kind of in a heap of\n2615.13 trouble here's how you read financial\n2616.69 statements so whether it's the guy in\n2618.73 the warehouse or you know your accounts\n2620.89 receivable staff or the salesperson\n2623.68 everybody is looking at the same\n2625.93 scorecard because there's no reason you\n2627.88 know I think what the biggest we were\n2631.269 victim of it too were you know you feel\n2632.859 like as the owner you're the one that\n2634.299 should hold all the burden and be alone\n2636.4 and be looking at the scorecard by\n2638.349 yourself when everybody else is there\n2640.93 technically your teammates right well\n2644.14 you know you might want to be interested\n2645.91 in another book the one that sort of\n2650.74 gets overlooked it's the second books\n2653.92 that I wrote with Jack stack called a\n2656.92 stake in the outcome a stake in the\n2659.769 outcome is more of the story of what\n2664.299 happened and it includes a lot of the\n2667.68 really difficult challenges that came up\n2672.819 along the way the the the you know that\n2678.13 there were a lot of at various points\n2682.98 you\n2684.1 crises that have to be overcome in order\n2688.09 to do this and in order to build the\n2691.84 company that they have in fact built and\n2695.35 that story is told much more in a stake\n2699.97 in the outcome than in the great game of\n2701.92 business the great game of business is\n2703.96 really just laying as the system the\n2708.36 stake and the outcome is is as as the\n2712.24 subtitle puts it building a culture of\n2714.91 ownership and it is it it's the raw\n2722.56 story yeah right right the hard part I\n2728.97 could keep going on for hours Bowl he'll\n2731.74 love it okay so what do you want to do I\n2735.07 want you to say well you know if there's\n2737.47 one you know because our listeners are\n2740.56 made up of the people that you\n2743.11 interviewed in all your book you know if\n2744.52 there's one takeaway one thing we\n2746.95 haven't chatted about just yet what\n2749.08 would you leave with what would you\n2750.64 leave them with well the people I mainly\n2755.23 write about and the people I think who\n2757.33 mainly are my are the readers of the\n2761.8 things that I write at least the ones\n2764.95 who like what I write are people who are\n2767.86 building their own cut their own\n2770.82 companies they're entrepreneurs and I\n2776.7 would say that the most important thing\n2781.29 to understand I mean there are a lot of\n2784.87 things that I should I would sort of\n2787.45 advise somebody to do one of which is\n2789.94 sort of the idea at behind small giants\n2795.55 namely what exactly is it makes a\n2798.37 company great I think that you know when\n2800.86 you look at the companies in small\n2802.45 giants that's really the question that\n2805.03 they put on the table you know and\n2807.28 different people will have different\n2808.33 answers to that question but it's a\n2811.03 question that everybody should be asking\n2812.98 and what what are you looking for out of\n2815.65 why are you doing what you're doing\n2818.08 what are you looking for out of business\n2819.52 out of work out of life and and what\n2823.72 does it mean to you if if your goal is\n2826.21 to build a great company well what\n2828.16 exactly does that mean to you and you\n2832.48 know in small Giants I suggest what what\n2836.47 you know the people I write about how\n2838.84 they answered that question it wasn't\n2841.18 always identical in every case but there\n2844.87 were some you know similarities and I\n2848.98 think that that's a very important\n2851.47 question for people to ask but I think\n2854.17 the thought you were to really press me\n2856.72 and to say what I think is the most\n2859.21 important thing and I would say I'm it's\n2862.99 very affected by what I learned in\n2865.48 writing finish big namely that you're on\n2868.3 a journey and that that journey is going\n2870.97 to end and that you need to think of it\n2873.49 as a journey not as a construction\n2875.95 project construction project may be one\n2878.47 of the things you do it will be one of\n2880.75 the things you do in the in the course\n2883.3 of the journey but it's important to\n2885.31 understand that that the journey it goes\n2890.23 on beyond that you know and and you and\n2896.89 you have to sort of think about the not\n2900.01 only you have to think about what\n2901.66 happens in the journey you also have to\n2903.88 think about how the journey ends and\n2905.89 what's going to happen after the journey\n2907.9 are you going to have another journey\n2909.55 that's fine are you in fact building is\n2916.21 your journey about building this great\n2918.16 company that's going to last after you\n2920.23 that's fine too\n2921.91 is it or is it about you know building a\n2926.05 company and then selling it for as much\n2928.15 money as possible and I I don't make any\n2931.84 value judgments about that I think\n2934.15 that's a first that's a fine thing to do\n2936.28 if that's what you really want to do but\n2939.85 the important thing is to is to be clear\n2942.49 in your own mind well as I say in both\n2945.88 finish big and in small giants to be\n2948.55 clear in your own mind about who you are\n2950.92 what\n2951.64 you want and why I think that that I\n2954.61 have found in the course of however long\n2957.61 it's been that I've been writing about\n2959.34 entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship and\n2961.6 entrepreneurial companies the most\n2963.58 important quality is something that is\n2967.95 probably an important quality for\n2970.87 everybody everybody whether they have\n2974.92 companies or not whether they're\n2976.21 entrepreneurs are not namely to really\n2978.67 understand who you are what you want and\n2981.31 why that's not always an easy thing to\n2985.12 do in fact it's a very hard thing most\n2988.36 most of us spend our entire lives trying\n2991.3 to figure that out you know the great\n2993.73 poets and playwrights and novices\n2998.29 everybody as philosophers write have\n3000.93 have written about the importance of you\n3005.07 know the struggle you know the proper as\n3007.73 Alexander Pope put it the proper study\n3010.56 of mankind is man\n3013.14 meaning ourselves and the man man's\n3017.64 search for meaning you ever read that\n3019.35 book yes yeah sure of course another one\n3022.59 you know it figures right into it well\n3025.35 the intrinsic reflection of who you are\n3027.57 is a lot more difficult than just\n3029.25 quarterly reports isn't it it sure is\n3032.46 and and the other thing is that you know\n3035.7 when you get to be my age you realize\n3037.53 that a lot of the times it's it's during\n3041.4 that that really tough times that you\n3044.1 find out who you are and you find out\n3046.8 what it is that really matters to you\n3050.1 and you know that's a whole process as I\n3052.86 say it's something that you probably\n3054.12 spend your whole life doing but it's\n3056.97 something that you need to be conscious\n3059.7 of that this is a challenge that lays\n3064.41 ahead of you and that you need to be\n3068.58 working on and thinking about because\n3070.95 you know what I found was small giants\n3073.53 was that all the companies all the\n3077.42 entrepreneurs who owned the companies\n3080.06 that I wrote about were people who had\n3084.12 very clear ideas\n3085.349 who they wanted and who they were what\n3088.079 they wanted and why because they\n3089.43 couldn't have made the decisions that\n3092.16 they did if they if they hadn't\n3094.709 particularly you know when people are\n3095.94 telling you a lot of people if you don't\n3098.549 know who you are what you want and why\n3100.14 what you wind up doing is what other\n3101.609 people think you should do listen all\n3104.759 the other voices that are just yours are\n3107.64 in guiding you and it was also very\n3110.729 important with the people in finish big\n3113.759 the people I wrote about in finish big\n3117.289 you know again you know the way people\n3122.519 get into trouble is if they are really\n3126.42 unclear about what it is what it is it's\n3130.859 motivating them I tell the story of\n3132.959 Bruce Lee who was one of the founders of\n3137.579 evolve in Chicago and how he basically\n3141.93 wound up selling a large chunk of his\n3148.469 company to a private equity firm without\n3151.019 actually figuring out well what was it\n3153.119 that he liked about his company and not\n3156.959 after that about yeah he did he it took\n3159.959 him a while but he eventually discovered\n3162.839 that he what it was that he was missing\n3165.93 and you know that's gonna happen well I\n3170.759 I can't thank you enough for coming on\n3173.16 the show it's uh it's an honor because I\n3175.41 just love your work so much well I I\n3178.17 love the questions
