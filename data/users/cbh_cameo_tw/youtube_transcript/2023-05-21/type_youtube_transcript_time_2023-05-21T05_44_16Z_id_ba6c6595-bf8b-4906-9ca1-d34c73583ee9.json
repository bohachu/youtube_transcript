moment to\n73.84 introduce yourselves tell us just a\n75.76 little bit about you personally\n77.52 yeah i'm a editor at large at ink\n80.88 magazine i've actually been on the staff\n83.2 of ink magazine for 32 years\n86.479 32 of its 35 years\n90.4 and\n92.799 it's been quite a ride\n94.88 i've written a few other books\n97.759 i wrote two with jack stack who's really\n100.4 the pioneer of open book management one\n102.799 called the great game of business\n105.2 was listed as one of the 100 best books\n108.079 of all time\n109.36 uh i wrote a book called small giants\n112.24 which was a uh\n114.159 companies that choose to be great\n115.84 instead of big that was a\n118.079 finalist for the\n120.0 um\n121.36 financial times goldman sachs\n124.32 business book of the year award\n126.56 uh i co-authored a book with nor brodsky\n129.679 called street smarts\n131.68 that's actually the name of the\n132.879 paperback the it had a different name as\n135.28 a hardback\n137.36 and\n138.16 my latest book is uh is this one\n141.2 finished big\n142.48 how great entrepreneurs exit their\n144.959 companies on top so well i think one of\n146.879 the most impressive things uh not that i\n148.959 try and wrap up a whole lot into amazon\n151.2 and amazon reviews because that's one of\n152.48 the reasons why we started the podcast\n153.92 was you know sometimes there's one or\n155.68 two reviews and one's from someone's mom\n158.0 and the other one's from someone who uh\n159.76 who kind of hates hates life so i try\n161.92 not to put too much into that but but\n163.76 when there's\n164.879 uh numerous reviews and they're all\n167.44 fantastic uh it definitely makes me pay\n170.48 attention and every single one of those\n172.239 books you just mentioned and others uh\n174.959 have phenomenal\n176.8 phenomenal amounts of reviews and uh and\n179.92 ratings you know as far as four and a\n181.28 half five stars which is very difficult\n183.2 to do when you're not talking about yeah\n184.8 again if i guess if i wrote a book and i\n186.4 had my mom get on there i got one review\n188.56 and it's a five star but uh\n191.2 excellent excellent reviews on all these\n193.599 different books on amazon\n195.28 well i'm very flattered by that so um\n199.12 it it it's you know it's the reason you\n201.04 write a book is the hope people will\n202.879 like it so\n205.04 no that's fantastic and now let's jump\n206.959 right into this most recent one finish\n208.879 big\n209.76 how great entrepreneurs exit their\n211.36 companies on top which was uh made\n213.44 available not that long ago actually\n214.56 november of 2014 and but we're going to\n217.44 move quickly but our whole goal here\n219.44 today is to cover the top questions that\n221.599 our our fu our listener future reader\n223.92 would like to get answered\n225.599 and the first one is what was the\n227.12 inspiration behind writing finnish big\n230.159 well it really began with my uh\n233.28 sometime co-author norm brodsky i've\n236.319 been writing a column with him in ink\n238.4 magazine for almost 20 years now and he\n241.04 and i did write the book street smarts\n243.92 together\n245.68 in back in 2006 he decided to sell his\n249.439 company and he and i decided to write\n252.239 about it on a month by month\n255.2 basis\n256.32 and we just got a tremendous amount of\n259.759 reader response i mean we were just\n262.0 flooded with emails people suggesting\n264.88 what he should do\n266.24 and i realized that there was this uh\n268.72 huge appetite out there\n271.68 uh for understanding what was the\n274.16 experience of selling a company\n277.04 and i\n278.32 we actually hadn't written very much\n280.56 even though i'd been at inc for 26 years\n283.28 or whatever at that point\n285.36 we seldom written about um\n288.88 the exit process and so i was actually\n292.08 very curious about it\n294.32 i realized pretty quickly i didn't know\n296.16 much about it um\n298.479 and uh\n299.919 that's really what led me into doing the\n302.639 book that's fantastic and and this next\n304.72 question is really to help differentiate\n306.32 because we talk about all the time\n307.84 entrepreneurs are inundated with books\n309.84 150 200 plus books a month come out on\n312.639 amazon alone on entrepreneurship and so\n315.199 this question is what makes your book\n316.56 different from the others regarding the\n318.639 same or similar topic\n320.96 well\n321.919 that was actually one of the reasons\n324.88 that i wrote the book as well that i did\n327.36 enough online if you if you go online\n329.759 and you look at any other aspect of a\n331.84 business starting a business growing a\n333.84 business\n334.8 financing a business\n336.8 managing uh a business and so forth you\n340.24 you do a google search on them you'll\n342.56 get\n343.28 several million uh\n345.919 hits\n346.96 uh if you if you go to exiting a\n349.28 business\n350.32 you'll get about somewhere between a\n352.4 fifth and a tenth of that amount\n354.8 and what's more all of those almost all\n357.68 of those i would say even all of them\n359.759 are really about how do you get the best\n361.759 deal for your business in other words\n363.44 it's about the financial\n365.44 part of the\n367.12 uh\n368.08 of the equation\n369.919 what i realized from norm and then from\n372.96 the interviews that i did was you know\n375.52 the financial part is important it's\n377.44 important to get rewarded for what you\n379.44 did but really the biggest challenges\n382.24 are emotional not financial and a lot of\n385.36 them come after\n387.36 the actual deal is done and people are\n390.319 generally unprepared for them\n393.039 so uh i don't know frankly of any book\n396.479 out there on exits which is like mine\n400.24 in the sense that it's really all about\n402.8 the experiences of\n405.6 people\n406.479 who've gone through it and what you know\n408.72 what their experience is is good and bad\n411.36 and there's both good and bad in the\n413.68 book\n414.56 fantastic so bo this next question was\n416.319 actually one that came from an author uh\n418.0 david allen getting things done asked\n419.52 him what what question we were missing\n421.199 from this interview and he said you\n422.88 should ask how uh how how the author\n424.96 suggests the reader engaged with the\n426.4 book and meaning i guess we're gonna ask\n428.96 you that same thing did you write it\n431.28 so that people can jump in and jump out\n433.039 cherry-picking information as needed or\n435.44 did you really write it to be read from\n437.28 front to back\n439.199 well i you can read it either way and i\n442.319 tried to set it up so that people could\n445.28 jump in or jump out if they wanted to\n448.16 they could look at the table of contents\n450.24 they could look at the headlines and\n451.919 subheads\n453.039 and uh and and they could do that if\n456.0 they wanted to\n457.759 uh i will say that i think very few\n460.0 entrepreneurs will do that i think most\n462.72 people once they start the book are\n464.479 going to want to read it completely\n466.24 through\n467.199 uh\n468.479 and i say that because\n470.56 um it exposes uh if you were if you were\n473.759 an entrepreneur even if you're just as\n475.599 an aspiring entrepreneur it exposes you\n478.879 to a whole\n480.24 side of business and a way of thinking\n482.319 about business that you're not used to\n485.44 and it'll it'll\n487.599 immediately\n488.96 uh lead you to\n491.039 ask to to wonder about many many things\n495.199 and they're things you should be\n496.72 thinking about from a very very early\n499.039 stage of your business so but what are\n501.36 my favorite part of the entire book i\n502.8 mean you've given us a great background\n504.479 and some purpose behind the book so now\n506.24 let's take a deep dive into the content\n507.759 itself uh we take the next five to eight\n509.599 minutes and really give the future\n511.12 reader a great idea of what they can\n513.2 expect to get out of your book sure\n515.76 i guess the thing i would emphasize is\n517.68 that this is a book with stories uh it's\n520.8 like most of most of the books that i've\n522.8 written\n524.08 they're about story they have stories of\n526.32 entrepreneurs uh each story has a point\n529.44 it's not just a collection of stories\n532.08 but what the the whole idea of the book\n535.279 and what you will find throughout the\n536.8 book uh is stories of uh real people\n540.959 having real experiences in exiting uh\n544.399 their businesses or getting ready to\n546.72 exit their businesses\n548.399 the introduction is the story of how the\n550.48 book came to be written\n552.399 uh talks about what i referenced earlier\n556.24 and one of the things i found i mean i\n558.8 interviewed\n560.08 dozens and dozens and dozens of\n562.32 entrepreneurs\n563.92 uh to find out what their experiences\n567.6 had been\n568.8 uh in going through an exit and what i\n572.16 found was that about half of them were\n574.56 reasonably happy at the end of the\n576.8 process and about half of them were\n578.56 totally miserable\n580.24 and wished that they'd never sold their\n582.399 business had we're just full of regrets\n585.04 uh and\n586.8 you know we're living with them and so i\n589.519 asked uh\n590.959 well okay what's the difference between\n592.56 a good exit and a bad exit and in order\n595.2 to do that i had to define what a good\n597.36 exit was\n598.72 and i came up with uh\n601.279 five\n602.32 uh qualities of a good exit one is that\n605.12 at the end of the process\n606.88 you can you feel as though you've been\n608.56 fairly treated and appropriately\n610.399 rewarded for the work that you did\n612.88 in uh building the business number two\n616.079 you have a sense of accomplishment you\n617.92 can look back with pride\n620.16 uh on what you did when you had the\n622.16 business number three\n624.16 you're at peace with what has happened\n626.24 to the other people who are on the\n628.0 journey with you\n629.839 number four you have a new sense of\n631.76 purpose outside the business and for\n634.72 some people not for all but for some\n636.88 people uh it's important to see that the\n639.76 company is uh still thriving without\n642.399 them uh in the driver's seat\n645.68 um\n646.88 chapter one is really the story it\n649.44 begins with the story of a very good\n651.519 exit\n652.88 um and\n654.399 i i really\n656.56 want people to have an idea\n659.12 of\n660.56 what the book is going to be about and\n663.44 you know the title of the chapter is\n666.0 every journey ends and i'm really saying\n668.56 to people here\n670.24 you need to think about your\n672.48 your experience as the owner of a\n674.48 business as a journey and it's something\n677.6 it's a journey that has a beginning a\n679.76 middle and an end and building a company\n682.64 is not the end of that business that's\n685.2 the middle of the business\n687.2 the end of the business is when you\n689.2 leave that company\n692.24 the other thing i want people to\n694.079 understand is you know most of us think\n696.48 of an exit as an event that you know\n698.959 eventually happens at some point in the\n701.519 life of the business\n703.04 uh i realized as i got into this that\n706.48 that's the wrong way to look at it an\n708.48 exit is actually a phase of the business\n710.88 you know you have the startup phase you\n712.64 have the growth phase you have the\n714.72 maturity phase and you have the exit\n717.279 phase and there are actually four stages\n720.24 to that\n721.2 uh\n722.32 to that phase of the business\n724.399 uh the first one is what i call the\n726.56 exploratory phase it's when you are\n729.2 really\n730.399 educating yourself about what the\n732.56 possibilities are\n734.88 the second one\n736.399 is the strategic phase that's when you\n739.04 have an idea of the kind of exit you\n741.279 want and you go about building into your\n744.48 company the qualities that are going to\n746.72 allow you to have that kind of an exit\n749.68 the third phase is the execution phase\n752.8 that's when you actually go out and look\n754.56 for a buyer\n755.92 most people\n757.36 start at the third phase without going\n759.92 through phases one and two and it's a\n762.24 huge mistake\n764.16 uh you know they they they put off doing\n767.279 the necessary preparatory work at a\n770.0 certain point they realize they're not\n771.6 going to live forever or they want to go\n773.6 on and do something else or they're\n775.12 bored and they go and call up a broker\n778.32 or uh\n780.32 or an investment banker\n782.72 the wrong way total wrong way to do it\n786.0 and then the fourth phase is actually\n788.48 the most\n790.48 uh difficult and that's the transition\n793.12 phase that's after you've sold the\n795.12 business\n796.399 what happens between the sale of the\n798.48 business and whatever comes next\n801.44 uh\n802.24 whatever is the next thing that you're\n804.48 going to be totally engaged in\n807.12 um and when i looked at the difference\n809.44 between the good and the bad companies\n811.76 the good and bad exits i mean\n814.88 many people with good companies had bad\n816.88 exits unfortunately\n819.04 i came up with seven factors and i\n821.6 really structure seven and a half\n823.6 factors and i really structure\n825.92 the book\n827.04 around those factors\n830.079 and so chapter two\n832.48 is is titled who am i if not my business\n836.48 and it's about the importance of knowing\n839.76 who you are what you want and why\n842.959 this is something that i have found\n845.519 over and over again in all the years\n848.16 that i've been covering entrepreneurs\n850.399 those who do best in terms of building a\n853.199 business and who do best in terms of\n855.44 exiting business have worked very hard\n858.24 on trying to figure out who they are\n861.04 what they want and why\n863.92 the truth is is that if you put that off\n866.639 if you don't think about it\n868.72 as soon as you're actually you're gonna\n870.24 you're gonna run smack into that\n871.839 question and there's gonna be no way to\n873.6 avoid it\n875.199 the the second\n877.04 that was that's the first factor\n879.519 separating the people with good exits\n881.68 from bad exits the second factor has to\n884.56 do with building a company that's\n887.199 sellable and what i mean by that is one\n890.32 you can sell\n891.92 when you want to whom you want at a\n894.48 price you want\n897.36 there's some something called a forced\n900.079 sale that happens when something you\n902.639 totally don't foresee comes along you've\n905.44 got a very good company and then all of\n907.36 a sudden something happens if it catches\n910.24 you by surprise and you're forced to\n912.399 sell either to who\n914.56 not when you want or to somebody you\n917.04 don't want to sell to and you\n919.36 often get a very bad deal\n922.639 afterwards\n924.88 so it's very important to understand\n927.279 what a sellable business is and i do\n930.32 write about uh the eight factors that\n933.279 sort of go into it and also what you can\n936.48 learn other places you can go to learn\n938.639 about building a sellable business\n941.36 the third factor has to do with time\n944.959 most people do not give most business\n947.519 owners do not give themselves anywhere\n949.92 near enough time to do the preparatory\n952.56 work and when i talk about time i'm\n955.04 talking in terms of\n958.0 years not months\n960.8 the fact is there's no\n962.56 point too early to start at least the\n965.279 exploratory phase\n967.199 you can do that even before you even uh\n969.759 start the company uh but\n973.279 the the\n974.399 the big mistake that people make is that\n976.72 they don't give themselves enough time\n980.32 and i tell various stories\n982.639 about um\n984.32 people\n986.56 to give you a clear sense of exactly\n989.279 what the amount of time you need is and\n992.48 i will say this is that the more\n994.0 ambitious you are for your company the\n996.56 more you care about having it last\n998.48 beyond you the more time you're going to\n1000.8 need\n1002.079 uh to prepare for your exit\n1004.8 uh the\n1006.079 the the next point is really sort of\n1008.079 related to\n1011.12 the having enough time and that's for\n1013.44 some people it's important to have a\n1015.519 successor not for everybody when they\n1017.92 sell their company but for a lot of\n1019.6 people it's important to have a\n1021.36 successor and you need a lot of time to\n1023.839 get the right accessor successor in fact\n1026.88 you need to give yourself enough time to\n1028.959 be wrong because practically everybody\n1031.28 gets it wrong the first time and they\n1033.839 learn some lessons and then if they're\n1036.559 lucky and good they're able to to do it\n1039.6 the next time\n1041.28 um\n1043.28 chapter the chapter six which is\n1045.52 actually the fifth\n1047.36 uh\n1048.48 excuse me the fourth point\n1051.44 um\n1052.96 it has to do with making sure that you\n1054.799 get the advice you need and i make a\n1057.2 very strong case in here for uh making\n1060.32 sure that you have a guide\n1062.559 who has been through it himself or\n1064.96 herself before\n1067.6 they have a perspective on it that is\n1069.84 different from uh this perspective you\n1072.32 will get from an exit professional a m a\n1075.679 attorney or\n1076.96 uh an investment\n1078.96 banker or broker uh because they know\n1082.48 that that the the exit doesn't end with\n1085.679 the deal\n1086.88 uh for the investment banker the broker\n1089.12 the deal is it once it's over they go on\n1091.679 to something else it's not over for the\n1093.84 business owner and you need somebody\n1096.88 guiding you who understands that a lot\n1100.16 of people do that by making the big\n1101.919 mistake of they learn the hard way by\n1105.36 doing their own exits and screwing\n1107.44 everything up\n1109.12 but they are often oddly enough turn out\n1111.919 to be the best guides\n1114.88 the next factor\n1117.12 the fifth factor uh has to do with what\n1120.32 happens to\n1121.76 the other people who you've been on the\n1123.6 journey with nobody builds a company\n1125.919 alone\n1127.52 and you need to be at peace\n1130.559 with whatever is going to happen to your\n1133.2 employees to your investors to whoever\n1135.44 else has been with you on the journey\n1138.559 if you do not pay attention to that\n1142.32 you will live to regret it i mean i tell\n1146.08 a story there of somebody who who\n1148.72 couldn't talk about his exit 12 years\n1151.76 after he left his company because he\n1153.919 felt so bad\n1156.0 about the way he'd handled his employees\n1159.6 it's something that is critical to pay\n1161.679 attention to\n1163.52 the sixth factor uh is a chapter i call\n1167.919 caveat vendetta\n1169.76 in other words let the seller beware\n1172.48 when you're selling a business it's easy\n1174.24 to forget\n1175.6 that that the buyer is also selling\n1178.64 themselves they're selling themselves\n1180.64 that they're going to be a good owner of\n1182.32 the company that they're going to take\n1183.919 good care of it that they're going to\n1185.84 they love your employees that they love\n1188.24 everything that they do that they think\n1189.919 you're the most brilliant person in the\n1191.679 world and they really want to uh they\n1194.559 really\n1195.6 want to keep doing it most of them are\n1197.6 lying frankly uh because they want to\n1200.64 they want to own the business and it's\n1202.72 very important to understand\n1205.44 really why\n1207.28 the buyer wants your business and to\n1210.32 look at it in a\n1212.4 cold\n1213.6 unemotional way\n1215.679 because otherwise you're absolutely\n1218.48 setting yourself up for big unpleasant\n1221.039 surprises after you sell the business\n1224.08 and the final part in the final chapter\n1226.48 is really it's over the rainbow it's\n1228.88 after the sale itself\n1231.039 and that is the hardest part of this\n1234.24 because\n1235.6 uh\n1236.799 what happens i realized i mean there's\n1238.72 one person who i write at the beginning\n1240.72 of the chapter about it took him 15\n1242.559 years\n1243.679 to figure out why he felt so bad after\n1247.039 he'd sold his business in the end he\n1249.28 wound up writing a disa phd dissertation\n1252.799 on the subject of owners who sell\n1254.799 private businesses and what their\n1256.4 experiences have been\n1259.919 and i realized\n1261.6 in writing this chapter that you know\n1263.919 there are a lot of things that people\n1266.0 get out of their businesses that they're\n1267.919 not aware of\n1269.52 until they don't have many more\n1271.76 for example a sense of purpose\n1274.24 uh an identity a tribe people who they\n1278.08 see every day and work with every day\n1281.039 um\n1281.919 uh a a sense of accomplishment one of\n1285.28 the great things about business is that\n1287.12 you can see your what exactly you're\n1289.28 accomplishing as you go along structure\n1291.919 in other words knowing what you should\n1293.76 do next when you suddenly don't have any\n1297.039 of those things\n1298.72 if you haven't prepared yourself\n1300.559 adequately you feel totally lost\n1303.6 the people who have really good exits\n1306.72 figure out how to get them back\n1309.28 and usually because they have money now\n1312.4 after they've sold their business\n1314.32 they're able to get it back and to do\n1316.48 what they did before at a higher level\n1319.919 so what did they do before\n1322.0 well when you think about it your sense\n1323.84 of purpose in business comes from the\n1326.559 people you serve\n1328.24 everybody who has a successful business\n1330.96 serves other people\n1333.039 you at least serve your customers\n1335.2 because you wouldn't be\n1337.6 uh you wouldn't be successful if you\n1339.679 didn't you're probably serving your\n1341.52 family as well for a lot of people\n1343.52 they're serving their employees\n1346.72 you're serving your community as well\n1350.24 and it's that sense of service that\n1352.32 gives every makes gives everything else\n1354.559 that you're doing\n1357.2 meaning\n1358.4 and when you lose that it's very\n1361.36 important and the people who go through\n1364.08 the exit and wind up on top of the world\n1367.36 not only with their money but feeling\n1369.52 great about what they're doing are\n1371.44 people who figure out how to recreate\n1374.72 that sense of service afterwards\n1377.919 uh and that's really that that's really\n1380.32 where we wind up with the book that was\n1382.159 the big discovery i made in uh in\n1384.88 writing the bull\n1386.24 bill you did a fantastic job of breaking\n1388.64 down uh that book and you did great on\n1391.12 timing as well uh putting that much\n1392.88 information and that's what leads us to\n1394.64 this next question as well as you you\n1396.159 did you just gave us a ton of great uh\n1398.88 content with context along with it and\n1400.96 it's so this question i think is fairly\n1402.559 difficult sometimes if the reader can\n1404.0 only take away one concept\n1406.0 principle or action item out of\n1407.44 everything you just discussed with us\n1409.12 out of your entire book what would you\n1410.88 want that to be\n1412.159 well if it was only one thing i would\n1414.08 say that you need to start preparing for\n1416.32 it early\n1417.6 there is no point that's too early to\n1420.32 start preparing for this to start\n1422.24 thinking about this and when i say to\n1424.32 start thinking about it i mean starting\n1426.32 the exploratory phase in other words\n1429.36 figuring out\n1430.72 uh\n1431.76 what are the different possibilities\n1433.76 what are the ways this can go and and\n1436.799 and developing a vision for yourself\n1439.84 about where you want it to go\n1442.159 if you were to give me a second one\n1444.4 i would say\n1445.679 uh it's this question of service\n1449.36 understand\n1450.88 how important that is to you\n1454.24 as a business owner\n1456.48 um\n1457.6 because\n1458.48 really\n1459.44 there is so much that that grows out of\n1462.08 that\n1462.96 um that it really gives you\n1465.84 uh\n1466.64 a north star it guides you\n1469.2 uh as you go as a business owner and\n1471.84 also as a former business owner\n1474.72 so beau there's been so many quote\n1476.799 worthy things i mean there was a couple\n1477.919 of queer things that you just got done\n1479.52 saying uh in that last question that\n1481.84 actually leads to\n1483.2 our last question for the book that's do\n1484.799 you have a favorite quote from your book\n1487.2 and can you take a minute to explain\n1488.96 what it means to you\n1490.64 yeah i would say\n1493.12 there's a saying\n1494.48 that you should build your business\n1496.88 as if it's going to last forever but you\n1499.84 could sell it tomorrow\n1501.6 that\n1502.64 quote that\n1504.32 saying\n1505.919 uh contains a lot\n1508.559 of very very important information\n1512.64 you build a business\n1514.64 as if\n1516.08 you were building it for the ages as if\n1519.039 it was going to last long beyond you\n1522.08 but\n1522.96 you could sell it tomorrow\n1525.36 in other words now the reason is that if\n1527.76 you prepare correctly\n1530.48 for your exit and you do the necessary\n1534.08 work it's not only that you'll have a\n1535.6 better exit you'll have a better company\n1538.159 because you'll have a company one of the\n1540.0 things that forces preparing for the ex\n1542.48 it forced you to do it it forced you to\n1544.559 look at your company the way and uh\n1547.52 an independent investor who has\n1550.24 absolutely no emotional ties to the\n1553.279 business would look at it and you the\n1555.84 and you'd look at the kind of practices\n1558.0 you need to implement in order to have\n1560.64 that kind of a company the result is\n1562.799 that you'll have a better company uh\n1565.36 you'll have a better company that's more\n1567.2 valuable for you to own if you plan to\n1570.08 to give it or to sell it or turn it over\n1572.96 to your children\n1574.559 it'll be better for them if you plan to\n1576.72 sell it to your employees it'll be\n1578.64 better for them\n1580.88 if you plan\n1582.08 to just sell it to a third party\n1584.64 you'll get a better price for it so um\n1587.84 you know that's really\n1589.84 really the the kernel of the idea\n1593.6 um\n1594.64 that needs to drive you not only in\n1596.559 terms of preparing for an exit but in\n1598.72 terms of building a great business\n1601.039 excellent well thank you for sharing\n1602.159 that and we'll put out the show notes a\n1603.44 lot of our listeners are mobile right\n1605.44 now and they'd like to reflect on that a\n1606.799 little bit more so they can go to the el\n1608.72 podcast.com and and further\n1611.52 think about that quote and and bo\n1613.84 this next question is obviously it's a\n1615.039 book centric podcast we have to ask and\n1617.44 and uh the book uh lovers out there are\n1620.559 always looking for for that\n1621.76 recommendation but we're not asking for\n1623.679 just any\n1624.96 uh suggestion we're asking for the\n1626.96 suggestion so if there's only one book\n1628.64 you could recommend our listeners based\n1630.559 on the way that it's impacted your life\n1632.24 created you know a lifestyle shift or a\n1634.72 paradigm shift for you uh what book\n1636.88 would you recommend i was thinking about\n1638.96 this question\n1640.4 uh it's actually not a business book\n1642.64 that's fine uh i i was thinking\n1645.84 that well there are a number but i i was\n1648.159 thinking the killer angels\n1650.48 um which is the story of the battle of\n1653.36 gettysburg\n1655.84 and it's a very very well told story\n1658.32 it's a very exciting story and it's\n1660.72 about\n1662.08 courage under fire\n1665.76 and\n1668.08 if there's a book that had\n1670.799 a profound effect on me\n1674.08 it was that one\n1676.96 and really\n1678.96 realizing\n1680.72 you know it was the turning point of the\n1682.559 civil war which really sort of defined\n1685.12 the united states\n1687.44 thereafter and you know\n1690.159 i believe that\n1691.679 you know business\n1693.36 is a way to make the world a better\n1695.679 place\n1696.48 it's a way to create a better and a\n1698.399 stronger\n1699.44 country\n1700.64 and\n1702.559 i think that understanding\n1704.96 where our country comes from is\n1707.6 extremely important and that was killer\n1710.159 angels yes\n1712.0 okay i just looked that up fanta you\n1713.52 know that's the first time i've had that\n1714.72 book recommended\n1716.399 however the popularity i'm looking is is\n1719.44 unbelievable so i'm surprised that's\n1720.96 even the first time i've heard of it\n1722.48 thank you so much for that\n1723.36 recommendation i can't wait to uh to\n1725.44 purchase that and dive in\n1727.2 you will love it wait i can guarantee
