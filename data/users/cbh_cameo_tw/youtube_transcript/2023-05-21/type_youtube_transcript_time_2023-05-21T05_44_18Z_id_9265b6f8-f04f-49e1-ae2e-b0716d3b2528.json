"4.7 [Applause]\n9.2 so I'm so happy to see all my old\n11.94 friends here tonight and have you all\n13.74 here to enjoy this I hope you're as\n15.45 excited about this as I am this is a\n18.0 dream for me because I've been a big fan\n19.32 of Bo and is writing for many years bo\n22.26 is a contributor to Forbes magazine and\n24.599 a co-founder of the small Giants\n26.07 community before that and for 30 years\n29.099 he was executive editor or editor at\n31.529 large at ink magazine who switched from\n34.86 executive editor to editor at large was\n37.32 driven by a desire to spend more time\n38.969 writing and I'm personally very glad he\n41.16 did that because he's written two books\n43.649 on open books management the idea of\n45.539 open books management with the person\n47.28 who made the idea work so well I've\n49.26 actually never read either of those\n50.699 books I have to confess in fact I\n53.67 thought I had invented this idea of\n55.559 educating everyone on the company\n57.21 measuring results empowering people and\n59.19 sharing profits like I'm pretty good at\n61.05 this and then I read small giants and\n63.539 found out that somebody else had done\n65.19 this 20 years before and it already put\n66.96 a name around it and oh well so Bo's\n70.77 also the author of small Giants a book\n72.54 that tells the stories of companies that\n74.549 have chosen to be great instead of big\n76.549 atomic was five years old so that was in\n79.439 2006 and about 15 or so people when I\n82.56 read that book and I was a college\n85.14 professor who became an entrepreneur\n87.0 because I needed to do something with\n88.32 the smart people around me and I needed\n89.64 a job frankly and so launching atomic\n93.119 was like I don't know I don't I'm not\n94.86 trained I have three degrees in\n96.0 electrical engineering and nothing in\n98.04 business so I just have to make this\n99.27 stuff up I'll have to figure it out and\n100.86 I like solving problems and learning new\n102.63 things I was in you know hog heaven in\n104.399 terms of that but I was a little bit\n106.079 under confident that I was doing it the\n107.52 right way and reading small Giants five\n110.159 years in gave me that confidence and it\n112.53 legitimized my instincts legitimize how\n115.439 I thought company should run like huh\n117.09 I'm not crazy I'm not alone and this is\n119.009 gonna work out so it was really\n120.299 important to me small giants has helped\n124.59 us follow our strategy on focusing on\n127.649 being as good as we can possibly be\n129.66 always trying to get better and then\n131.55 treating growth as a side effect of\n134.1 being good at what we do wrestling with\n136.05 this problem of growth we called this\n137.97 strategy great not big\n139.51 shameless plug that's also the name of\n141.069 my blog when I learned that mayor bliss\n144.7 had declared small Giants to be the book\n147.129 of the year for Grand Rapids I reached\n149.019 out to Bo hoping that I could arrange an\n150.97 event around his most recent book finish\n153.19 big atomic is 16 years old this year\n156.489 I am presumably closer to leaving it\n160.75 than I am to have you started it I'm\n165.28 also very interested therefore in the\n167.68 subject of how one leaves something is\n169.81 awesome as atomic object I'm a\n172.75 precocious problem solver and I like to\n174.4 start early on these tasty problems so\n177.28 it turns out this is one of the pieces\n178.45 of advice in the book start early finish\n182.769 big was as insightful to me personally\n185.019 as small Giants was useful and\n187.78 insightful for atomic so Bo thanks for\n191.59 the books for the thinking for pulling\n193.54 that together and I'm really looking\n194.739 forward to this conversation\n202.41 as I was telling you in the car\n205.68 the secret to writing a successful book\n207.96 is to tell people things they already\n210.21 know and and and then and but everybody\n215.49 else is telling them they're crazy and\n218.13 and if you tell people what they already\n220.38 know and you say look you're not crazy\n222.39 look at these other companies that\n224.9 resonates did so great Segway can you\n230.19 tell us a little bit about why you wrote\n231.75 the book and and what went into\n233.25 gathering information for it yeah finish\n235.95 big is actually a little different from\n238.68 some of the other books I wrote in that\n241.32 I don't think that I don't think that\n245.43 people do already know the things that\n247.89 are in finish big I certainly didn't\n250.8 know them when I started out I actually\n252.6 knew nothing about the subjects you know\n256.02 I've been at ink magazine by that point\n258.84 for about 20 years and we seldom if ever\n264.03 wrote about exits we wrote about\n266.31 starting companies and growing companies\n268.19 but we just somehow left off the the\n273.48 last phase and that really my thinking\n278.97 of it really changed in I think was\n282.18 about 2006 I was writing a column which\n285.69 I still write with Noah broadsky who's a\n290.13 serial entrepreneur and and a very smart\n295.41 guy a guy who's got a lot of wisdom\n297.93 about business and he had a company\n303.54 called city storage which was\n308.25 essentially a records you know a they\n314.46 store records you know what are you\n316.14 doing in in a record storage businesses\n320.04 you put records and you put boxes\n324.99 basically on shelves and you take the\n327.87 boxes off the shelves\n330.57 not exactly the sexiest business\n333.27 around but it has actually got a lot of\n335.94 other qualities that made it quite\n338.01 valuable and in 2006 there happened to\n342.27 be an awful lot of interest in\n344.69 particularly in private equity people\n346.8 who wanted to buy record storage\n352.86 businesses and he came back from a\n356.91 conference that he'd been at and of\n359.73 course he'd also been in small giant so\n362.42 and he loved doing he loved the record\n365.49 storage business you know it was just\n367.95 putting boxes on shelves and taking them\n370.05 off shelves but he liked to say they'd\n372.3 love nothing better than to go into his\n374.13 warehouse and smell the cardboard\n376.11 I smell the software every day it's\n379.62 awesome so in any event he came back and\n384.41 from this conference and I was calling\n387.51 him up to ask him what the next column\n389.91 should be and he said well I think I'm\n394.74 actually gonna sell a business and I was\n397.08 totally shocked and turned out that he\n401.01 at this conference where he'd been that\n403.13 there was a private equity firm that had\n407.75 expressed interest in buying City\n410.1 storage and he had a couple of\n414.36 conditions that he thought would make it\n417.45 impossible for the company the private\n421.38 equity company to go forward with this\n424.47 and he told them of the conditions and\n426.84 they didn't bat an eye they said that's\n429.3 fine let's just go ahead and do this and\n431.52 so he was thinking well gee maybe I will\n433.05 do this and I said okay well gee I guess\n439.8 that'll be our next column so he said\n443.82 sure why not\n444.9 it turns out there are actually a few\n447.48 reasons why you don't want to be writing\n450.0 about the sale of your business in a\n452.28 national magazine\n455.37 as its as it's going as it's happening\n460.46 but that's what we did and it was very\n465.15 interesting what happened was that we\n467.88 developed the following they were as the\n472.05 process went along he was sort of\n478.88 struggling with the question of should\n481.139 he really go through this\n482.34 he wondered for example who's he going\n484.979 to be afterwards I mean would people\n488.07 still he was sort of a muckety-muck and\n492.96 that he figured had a lot to do with his\n495.3 money in his business\n496.58 would people still pay attention to him\n500.25 afterwards and so he went back and forth\n504.38 but he knew he knew he'd already for a\n507.93 long time felt that he was going to at\n511.41 some point sell the business and so we\n515.969 wrote about that week month after month\n518.52 and we asked people at one point to\n525.9 write in and basically give him advice\n528.18 should he go ahead with his deal or not\n530.279 he was just overwhelmed with the emails\n533.67 from people saying you know go for it\n536.19 nor him and eventually he decided yeah\n540.39 okay I'm going to go ahead and sell a\n541.74 business and by that point we had a big\n545.279 enough following that the editor of ink\n547.38 decided to make it a cover story norm\n553.43 and so that came out and the big picture\n561.0 of Norman recover and then a couple\n566.01 weeks later I had to call him up to find\n569.55 out what the next column was going to be\n572.1 I figured it'd be about the closing and\n574.92 I got him on the phone and I said well\n578.49 what's our next column about and he said\n580.35 well I said not to sell\n583.24 I said wait a minute we just told\n586.17 millions of people that you're selling\n588.67 he said well I found something out that\n592.63 really made me realize I can't trust\n594.52 these people they had sort of not told\n597.7 me who the key decision-maker was and it\n600.61 turned out that the key decision-maker\n602.29 was somebody he didn't think would\n604.6 fulfill the promises particularly those\n607.18 with regard to his employees and so he\n611.11 wound up not doing that deal and which I\n617.86 think shocked him is it's not as much as\n619.87 it shocked me that he could actually\n621.88 make that decision because he was\n623.77 totally invested in at that point\n625.709 eventually he did sell a majority stake\n629.02 in the business to another company we\n630.97 didn't write about that anymore\n633.45 that we wrote about afterwards but I I\n638.8 realized in you know doing this series\n644.589 that there was a lot of curiosity out\n646.899 there well what's it like to go through\n648.579 one of these experiences and I thought\n653.47 gee maybe there's a book there so I went\n655.42 and talked to my publisher and he\n657.91 thought yeah that sounds like a good\n660.31 book why don't you write a book about\n661.54 exit strategies I said okay so I had to\n667.57 figure out what to do and basically I\n670.029 knew nothing about the topic that all I\n671.95 knew was what I learned in going through\n675.19 this experience with norm and so I\n678.91 realized the first thing I had to do was\n680.89 to go that and go out and interview\n682.39 people other people who'd been through\n684.72 you know who'd been through the process\n686.829 themselves and the thing that I noticed\n690.81 very quickly I wound up doing somewhere\n695.47 between 100 and 50 interviews but what I\n698.079 noticed very quickly in the beginning\n699.85 was that an incredibly large number of\n703.99 people were unhappy that were full of\n708.64 regrets wish they hadn't sold their\n711.25 businesses and I thought gee that's\n714.279 pretty interesting I guess that's the\n716.529 book I should write what's the\n717.73 difference between the ones who wind up\n719.32 happy and the ones who wind up miserable\n722.699 and so that's how that's how so 100 250\n727.329 companies you talk to well I I did 100\n730.6 100 to 150 interviews so these weren't\n737.05 really companies a lot of these people\n738.64 were people who left their company\n741.66 entrepreneurs or some that there were\n745.329 also a whole bunch of people who were\n747.75 sort of in the process of getting ready\n751.54 to sell their businesses so but it was a\n756.61 lot it was a lot of people and the\n759.25 patterns over time became pretty clear\n762.49 to me you found four elements that had\n765.399 to be satisfied to have a successful\n767.77 exit as in like miss one of them and\n769.99 you're gonna be unhappy I had to define\n773.199 what a good exit was and I came up with\n776.68 as you say four things or five four plus\n781.209 one is the way I think about this one\n782.589 that's right it's four plus one the\n786.279 first one was that people had gone\n790.3 through the process and felt the process\n793.81 was fair and that they had been received\n798.399 an appropriate amount of money for what\n802.089 they put into the business the second\n805.57 one the second characteristic of a good\n810.25 exit was it which was really allowed by\n814.449 the first one which was that they could\n816.07 look back on what they'd done and feel a\n818.77 sense of pride knowing that they had\n822.69 built something and contributed\n825.13 something of value to the world the\n829.66 third quality had to do with the other\n831.94 people who'd been on the journey with\n834.13 them and that they felt at peace with\n838.27 what had happened to those people that\n840.4 was going to be different for different\n841.39 people obviously but it was important\n845.319 that\n845.96 they'd be at peace with whatever\n848.33 whatever it was the fourth one was that\n855.98 they had figured out what they were\n859.91 going to do next and had become engaged\n863.15 in that and for some people there was\n867.2 the fifth one this one it wasn't true\n870.47 for everyone but it was true for a lot\n874.01 of people was that they could the\n876.98 company was going on and in fact doing\n879.95 better than ever and you know which was\n884.99 really sort of an affirmation that they\n888.38 had done a good job on one of the most\n892.43 difficult transitions that any business\n896.08 has to go through that was that was it\n903.59 that was the fifth fact before I read\n905.84 your book I thought about exits as the\n908.84 exit as like some kind of I sign a piece\n911.36 of paper and I get a check and then like\n912.98 I'm done like a really narrow window of\n915.17 time an event an event yeah well I\n918.77 thought that too you know as long as I\n922.55 think I thought yeah okay well the X is\n925.1 something that happens at the end and\n926.57 it's an event but as I really went in\n930.74 and interviewed people I realized that\n934.97 that was the wrong way to look at it\n936.44 that in fact the exit is a phase of the\n939.68 business you know you have the startup\n942.17 phase yet the growth phase you have to\n944.18 make sure phase and you have the exit\n946.76 phase and that there are actually three\n949.99 four stages to it or there should be\n956.75 four stages to it the first stage is\n959.15 sort of the educational one where you're\n963.38 basically just teaching yourself\n966.52 learning what are the possibilities and\n971.36 which you know what could it be and\n975.38 which one would you prefer\n978.2 the second one is the strategic phase\n980.86 that's the fate the stage where you're\n985.84 basically building into the company\n989.33 you're building the company and you're\n991.79 building into it the qualities that are\n994.97 going to allow you to have the kind of X\n997.28 that you want the third phase is the one\n1001.03 that most people think of as the exit\n1004.9 and that's sort of begins when you call\n1008.5 up your lawyer your accountant or you\n1013.62 call up a broker or investment banker\n1016.57 and say okay I'm ready to sell can you\n1020.65 find me a buyer that faith that stage\n1024.91 ends with the deal as far as all those\n1029.86 other people are concerned that's it\n1032.35 it's the check you know they get paid\n1035.05 and they go on and do something else but\n1040.3 that's not the end for the entrepreneur\n1042.4 and this was key because people lot of\n1045.04 people don't realize this because in\n1048.88 fact there's a there's a fourth stage\n1052.03 which is the transition from being the\n1055.6 owner of a business and being you know\n1058.06 the head of the company and somebody\n1061.24 whom other people look up to and want to\n1066.51 you know I sort of relying on for\n1070.66 guidance and all kinds of other things\n1075.66 you go from that to being somebody whose\n1079.81 phone calls don't get returned and that\n1082.75 can be a tremendously difficult period\n1087.82 to go through you in the book you give\n1091.18 seven areas of advice for exiting\n1093.67 entrepreneurs right I really liked the\n1097.57 one that you talked about first which\n1101.26 was start with knowing yourself in a\n1104.23 nutshell can you talk about that one\n1105.46 little bit yeah it's the same thing was\n1107.38 true with\n1109.76 Giants actually that was the first\n1112.66 characteristics that I found with the\n1114.74 people who built small Giants was they\n1118.34 knew who they were they knew what they\n1120.8 wanted and they knew why they wanted it\n1123.35 that you know that's it's sort of not\n1129.71 the sort of thing that you go off for a\n1133.52 weekend and figure it out most of us\n1135.86 spend our entire lives trying to figure\n1137.72 that out\n1138.92 and oftentimes it takes very difficult\n1141.88 experiences where we find it out an\n1144.65 awful lot about ourselves by going\n1147.02 through very difficult experiences but\n1152.2 the people who know that almost all you\n1157.07 know are have a much better chance of\n1159.38 making decisions that they're going to\n1162.23 be happy with later on and you know if\n1166.67 you don't know that you wind up doing\n1169.58 what other people think you should do\n1171.23 and particularly when you go about go to\n1176.36 sell your company or to move on in some\n1179.6 way everybody's gonna have an opinion\n1181.61 about what you should do everybody you\n1183.62 talk to and they'll be advising you\n1185.84 about this that or the other thing and\n1188.36 it might or it might not be right to you\n1191.38 I would say but the fact of the matter\n1194.99 is that if you don't know that before\n1197.87 you do the deal\n1199.85 you're gonna you're gonna go run smack\n1202.34 into it after you do the deal because\n1205.46 one of the first questions is comes up\n1207.98 is Who am I what's my purpose here\n1212.96 what's my identity and people a lot of\n1218.57 people have to really struggle with that\n1222.46 there's a lot more I could say about\n1224.48 that we can go into that later but\n1226.22 thinking about what what you care about\n1228.62 was the thing that I took out of that\n1230.27 like deciding what I care about more\n1232.25 yeah\n1233.33 was very very useful to me yeah well\n1235.25 it's that's certainly true and that that\n1239.69 obviously varies\n1241.32 from person to person and from company\n1243.96 to company but it's it's very important\n1247.89 I mean one of the people I write about\n1251.4 is a fella named Bruce leach who had\n1256.11 started a company actually that did you\n1261.12 know cash registers point-of-sale\n1263.73 systems for big really big retailers and\n1268.16 company been very successful and he got\n1272.16 to a certain point where he got scared\n1276.78 basically they lost a big customer and\n1282.93 one of the people he brought in said to\n1285.21 him she you know this must be really\n1287.97 scary for you\n1289.59 if this compass anything happens to this\n1291.84 company you know I'll have to go out and\n1293.73 find another job but for you you'll just\n1296.31 be totally wiped out and he thought\n1304.56 about it and said well gee that's right\n1306.45 I bet I better do some preparation here\n1311.19 and so he began entertaining offers some\n1316.59 private equity firms that were\n1318.57 interested in buying into the company\n1320.46 and he told me a story about how\n1323.79 literally the night before the deal was\n1326.7 to close he was sitting in his office\n1328.71 and he had papers around him that he was\n1334.05 supposed to study in event and he's\n1335.85 supposed to sign the next day and he he\n1340.16 was really on the fence and he looked at\n1343.02 it and looked at all these papers and he\n1347.19 realized that everybody who was telling\n1349.41 him he should sell he had sort of a\n1352.41 vested interest in the deal invested\n1356.07 interest in the deal happening and he\n1358.53 sort of wondered she is anybody thinking\n1361.02 about me here part of the problem was\n1364.44 that he hadn't thought a lot about me\n1366.72 himself here and there were all kinds of\n1370.26 reasons why he should go through\n1373.14 this deal but you know he really hadn't\n1380.45 figured out if this was something that\n1382.8 he really wanted to do or what it was\n1384.95 that he cared most about his business it\n1389.79 took a long time but in the end he\n1392.61 decided there were so many people who\n1394.77 were depending on him through this deal\n1396.96 he better go ahead and do the deal so we\n1399.93 did and he had a horrible time\n1405.99 afterwards and eventually it took him a\n1411.69 long time but eventually we went to\n1413.91 visit another company in Chicago where\n1415.86 it was located\n1417.62 it had a great culture and as he put it\n1422.73 to me said I went from being uncle Bruce\n1425.42 you know to being somebody whose phone\n1429.87 didn't ring and he went so it was it was\n1436.08 really quite a while afterwards that he\n1438.57 was sort of forget it figuring out you\n1440.82 know he did did a lot of charity work\n1443.48 which was rewarding in some ways but not\n1447.45 the same thing and finally went to visit\n1451.83 this company and he saw what a great\n1454.92 culture it had and it hit him this is\n1458.07 what I miss this is what I miss you know\n1462.09 we had a great culture and it was a\n1465.39 culture that I'd helped create and where\n1469.5 I belong they didn't have that anymore\n1471.9 and that would have been a good thing to\n1477.87 think about before he did the deal by\n1480.45 the time he by the time the deal went by\n1482.88 the time the deal was done you know\n1485.13 there's no going back so he eventually\n1490.29 did find something to be engaged in\n1497.07 right now actually\n1498.33 he runs the Entrepreneurship Institute I\n1502.59 think it's called the Coleman on\n1504.18 entrepreneurship\n1505.74 - dad what's the University in Chicago\n1512.429 it's was a D DePaul yes at DePaul and\n1518.82 he's very engaged in that he also\n1522.12 co-founded northern organization for\n1525.72 people thinking about selling their\n1528.87 businesses or who had sold their\n1530.37 businesses so he found something to do\n1532.8 but took awhile give yourself time is\n1537.87 another one of these seven and I'm I\n1540.36 gotta ask how much time when do\n1542.4 successful exits start well basically\n1549.05 when you look at the way that the exit\n1552.99 process should go if you could if you're\n1555.69 conscious about it namely that there's\n1558.39 this first period the exploratory phase\n1562.679 when the stage when you're figuring out\n1565.29 what's involved it's never too early to\n1568.02 start that never and I personally think\n1573.42 that people are well advised to be again\n1577.17 thinking about that as early as they\n1580.76 think about going into business frankly\n1585.29 it's certainly something that they\n1587.84 should be thinking about after they get\n1591.36 into business because it's very easy and\n1596.45 frequently happens that people wind up\n1599.55 making decisions in the early days of a\n1603.6 business or in the course of growing the\n1605.55 business they're going to severely\n1607.26 restrict the ability the choices that\n1613.8 they're going to have at the end\n1616.55 particularly when it comes to equity and\n1621.92 you know when you're building a business\n1626.179 you know a lot you're often strapped and\n1629.52 sort of worried about whether or not\n1632.13 you're\n1633.97 money to pull off whatever planet is and\n1638.08 make payroll and so forth and it's very\n1640.75 tempting to give in to anybody who comes\n1645.67 along offering you money but the money\n1649.51 always comes with strings attached and\n1653.46 if if you're not really aware of what\n1659.82 those strings are you can wind up in a\n1663.67 situation where you know it'll be very\n1667.54 sad yeah one of the things that you\n1672.46 write about giving yourself time is the\n1676.42 ability to correct a mistake in a\n1679.33 succession decision yeah and I found the\n1681.55 stats on this depressing as hell yeah\n1684.67 about how many people don't get it right\n1686.8 the first time\n1687.46 well basically of all the companies I\n1690.67 interviewed there was one person who got\n1692.86 it right the first time and one out of a\n1696.88 hundred plus yeah and now I I should add\n1707.11 that you know not everybody I\n1709.42 interviewed really needed a successor\n1713.31 they wound up selling to another company\n1717.82 which sort of absorbed them so that if\n1721.93 it's if you're if the kind of X that you\n1725.14 want involves having a successor it's\n1730.09 it's frequently people make a lot of\n1736.06 mistakes just the way it is there's one\n1740.32 story I told although it was heavily\n1745.45 disguised I had to disguise it but it\n1748.42 was a woman who had a family owned\n1750.28 business and she was sort of the end of\n1753.19 the line and she knew that she needed to\n1756.04 bring somebody in to run the company\n1758.92 after her and it was a moving business\n1764.65 and\n1765.02 national moving company and they worked\n1767.72 with local movers so that the national\n1772.3 the the local movers would handle the\n1775.6 local or regional moving and the\n1780.98 national jobs her company would handle\n1784.19 and one of the one of the local regional\n1794.98 companies that was sort of in her\n1799.13 network had a guy who sort of been was\n1804.17 led by a guy who had been with the\n1807.17 company for a very long time and he had\n1810.05 a son who she had known since he was a\n1815.21 little kid and who wanted to have this\n1821.54 opportunity to come in and become CEO of\n1824.78 the company and she thought this was\n1828.65 just a blessing you know was like how\n1833.18 could and couldn't be better and she sat\n1838.76 down with her lawyer they sort of put\n1841.22 together the deal and everything and the\n1844.55 lawyer said well you've got to fight you\n1845.87 gotta have a way to get out of this and\n1848.45 she said well I'm not gonna get out of\n1850.52 this this is I've known this I've known\n1852.62 him since he was since he was a little\n1855.26 kid and I'm sure it's gonna be fine\n1859.82 and the way I said no you really need to\n1862.46 have sort of a way to get out of this\n1864.8 she said well okay you know if you\n1866.57 insist we'll put something in well the\n1870.77 guy came in it turned out to be someone\n1876.85 who was very different from what she had\n1881.03 imagined he had a he he would like go\n1887.36 around the office and say you know the\n1890.18 problem here is where overstaffed well\n1892.67 you know employees don't like to hear\n1897.76 they're the problem and and then he\n1902.36 talked about what we're gonna have to\n1903.68 change this when I take over we're gonna\n1905.9 we're gonna have to change this that and\n1907.58 the other thing and it was having a\n1909.38 really bad effect on morale and of\n1913.85 everybody in the company she called him\n1915.89 into his office into her office a couple\n1918.2 of times and said you know you can't\n1919.55 talk to people like this\n1921.05 you know even if you think that this is\n1923.54 true that's something that you have to\n1925.94 work out but you certainly don't go\n1928.25 around telling you know telling the\n1931.34 employees that you you think there are\n1934.1 too many people here but he kept you\n1940.73 know he would say yeah ok ok I\n1942.53 understand but he kept doing things like\n1944.72 that finally it got to a point where she\n1949.19 realized that she was very grateful to\n1953.21 her lawyer because before he because of\n1960.56 the cause that he put in the deal she\n1965.0 has the ability to get rid of this guy\n1970.25 and start over again and you know it was\n1975.05 a difficult experience for her but at\n1978.86 the same time a very educational one as\n1981.43 many difficult experiences are and\n1984.53 fortunately she had a chance she\n1986.72 realized that you know number one that\n1989.63 you don't really know somebody until\n1990.95 you've worked with them for a while and\n1998.2 number two that she needed to find\n2003.04 somebody who really understood the\n2006.88 culture that she had developed inside\n2011.47 the company and that frankly she wasn't\n2015.28 interested in changing because it had\n2016.99 been very successful for her and sure\n2021.79 enough she looked around and she found\n2023.38 somebody who'd actually been suggested a\n2025.93 while before\n2028.49 who did work in the company and who was\n2031.19 sort of a rising star in the company and\n2034.34 she realized that well you know maybe\n2036.62 she should have paid more attention to\n2038.45 that and she had that person take on new\n2046.1 roles and basically she didn't make the\n2049.129 mistake of immediately making him her\n2053.659 successor but she really went about the\n2057.11 process the way she should go about it\n2059.149 which is to really spend time getting to\n2067.58 know him and getting have a good sense\n2072.889 of what he would do when he was in the\n2075.02 top spot and that all that takes a lot\n2079.49 of time and that's I mean the fact is is\n2085.49 that the whole process of from the\n2089.48 beginning to the end of going of\n2092.899 figuring out what it is you want to do\n2095.12 but it could be a family business it\n2097.85 could be you could wind up selling to\n2099.53 your employees there are a whole lot of\n2102.14 different possibilities but it all takes\n2104.87 a long time and you need to have it in\n2112.37 mind not that you necessarily know\n2116.12 exactly what's going to happen at the\n2118.88 end but you need to have it in mind that\n2123.47 eventually there's going to be a big\n2126.91 transition here and it's going to be the\n2129.74 biggest transition that I've ever been\n2132.29 through and the biggest transition that\n2134.33 this company has ever been through and\n2136.34 you need to be thinking about that and\n2141.37 really preparing for that a long time in\n2145.1 advance why do you think we're not good\n2147.2 at doing these making this decision\n2149.0 these these bad successor decisions that\n2151.07 seem so common in your book why well you\n2155.81 know it's it's something that\n2159.549 the thing is is that so\n2167.69 going through the strategic phase and of\n2173.509 a bit for most people they've never done\n2175.67 it before you know and actually when you\n2179.45 get to a certain point it's really like\n2181.94 a whole new job and one of the big\n2184.729 mistakes that a lot of people make is\n2187.239 when they get into the third phase where\n2190.43 they're actually you know actively\n2192.589 preparing the company for sale is they\n2195.47 think they can do it themselves and\n2197.14 they've never done it before and they\n2201.68 don't know what they're doing and\n2202.999 they're bound to make a lot of mistakes\n2205.069 and usually they do and one of the one\n2211.339 of the people I write about it in the\n2215.18 book was somebody who I met he's\n2217.579 actually very very helpful to me he's in\n2221.89 Vancouver and he had a he had a hit a\n2227.96 business and he subsequently did a a\n2234.789 talk which is available actually online\n2240.969 on YouTube I think about how not this\n2244.7 out of business because he talked about\n2246.979 his own experience and and he identified\n2250.009 12 different mistakes that he'd made now\n2252.829 he happens to also be somebody who now\n2255.38 advises people and I found that people\n2258.499 who have actually been through it and\n2259.969 made all those mistakes or in some cases\n2262.609 the best people to turn to for advice\n2264.859 because they know what what the dangers\n2268.849 are and and and how you're gonna fall\n2271.19 into them so I have a suggestion though\n2274.309 I think you should write your next book\n2275.839 on successor selection\n2282.95 so this is a little bit specific to\n2285.559 atomic but I'm really curious to know we\n2287.51 have 32 employee-owners which is a\n2289.97 little bit more than half the company\n2291.38 yeah and I've gone from owning 83% of\n2293.93 the shares to 48% slowly over time in\n2296.9 the last eight years and we just\n2298.819 basically just made our own plan so it's\n2301.13 not a formal use no no no it made our\n2304.309 own plan so how to mostly the\n2310.4 significant amount of shares have been\n2312.079 mostly transferred through sales from me\n2314.809 to other employees I see and they they\n2317.99 volunteer and they come to you and say\n2319.91 after four or five years an offer comes\n2322.25 to them and they can choose to exercise\n2324.47 that offer offer they always have and\n2328.16 after one year they can start to\n2329.48 participate through a payroll deduction\n2332.049 into a smaller number of shares without\n2334.849 a judgement about me I mean okay so\n2337.28 that's how that's what got us to 30 it's\n2341.059 working really well but now I'm thinking\n2344.809 about a more formal ESOP at some point\n2347.96 yeah and I'm wondering if you've seen\n2350.24 any correlations with Aesop's and\n2353.329 successful founder exits yes I'm\n2357.98 watching one right now Jack stack of you\n2362.799 referred to is in fact going through the\n2369.47 process it's something that he's been\n2371.45 frankly preparing for for the last 30\n2374.39 years as long as I've known him\n2377.26 he calls it he wants to get out with a\n2380.24 clean conscience in other words he\n2382.88 doesn't want to get out and then have\n2385.04 the company get into trouble and feel\n2388.04 that he got his money and and now things\n2392.799 so he's been he's been working very\n2395.839 diligently on how to get to that point\n2399.589 and it's very interesting and actually\n2402.2 very exciting when you look at it\n2408.099 what's happened you know he's got people\n2411.29 in this company some of whom are you\n2415.94 know they're making $15 an hour you know\n2419.39 which is sort of become the standard\n2421.46 right $15 an hour $15,000 hours is about\n2425.65 $30,000 a year nobody got rich on\n2429.97 $30,000 a year as Jack points out the\n2436.31 way people make ultimately make money is\n2438.65 with equity and he's got people who work\n2441.98 on this line or making $30,000 a year\n2445.569 but you know they've been with the\n2448.4 company a long time they're part of the\n2450.29 ESOP and they have an estate worth one a\n2453.079 half a million dollars now that's a\n2455.21 game-changer talk about eliminating the\n2458.599 gap between the you know income\n2461.9 inequality and yeah it's not income and\n2465.38 its wealth inequality is the real issue\n2468.55 except for whatever reason you know the\n2472.609 unions I guess are sort of focused on\n2475.04 income inequality which really is not\n2478.67 the big issue and you know so now he's\n2486.71 there are certain advantages to having\n2489.349 an ISA for example you can become an S\n2495.26 corporation or S corporation is where\n2500.69 all of the profits and everything flows\n2504.68 right through to the owners well if\n2507.829 there's only one owner and that owner is\n2509.72 the ESOP you shops don't get taxed so if\n2513.89 you are a hundred percent owned by an\n2515.869 esop all your profits are not going to\n2521.3 be taxed which has all kinds of\n2523.49 wonderful effects as far as cash flow\n2525.71 goes eventually the government gets its\n2528.05 money gets its money when the when the\n2532.069 shareholders leave and they get paid and\n2534.77 then they have to get pay their taxes on\n2536.93 that so it's not as if the government\n2541.09 left out in the cold doesn't get\n2543.77 anything out of it but it has it's it's\n2548.18 something that you have to look at it's\n2550.58 also very tricky in that phase because\n2554.33 one of the big challenges with Aesop's\n2557.36 is that you're undertaking you know\n2565.48 people tend to focus on the fact that\n2567.98 isn't it great we're making everybody\n2570.59 owners here well okay yes but look what\n2578.51 that comes with is a very large\n2580.64 contingent liability in other words\n2583.37 someday you're gonna have to pay people\n2585.2 off and a lot of people make the mistake\n2590.77 mainly because they have bad advice of\n2593.44 not realizing that when you give when\n2599.77 you have a nice topping and the\n2602.95 employees do have ownership that\n2606.08 eventually you better be sure that\n2608.09 they're you're running the company in a\n2609.92 way where eventually you're gonna be\n2612.89 able to pay them off and that can get to\n2614.45 write them back you open it well well\n2617.0 yeah I mean it it gets to be very tricky\n2620.24 because you need to have people people\n2626.06 work hard and they're very highly\n2627.5 motivated if you run the company right\n2629.42 and they love working there and what\n2633.05 they're doing is they're pushing up the\n2635.0 value of their stock well they're\n2637.91 pushing up the value of their stock\n2639.08 which means that the contingent\n2641.09 liability is constantly getting bigger\n2643.31 and bigger and bigger so you you have to\n2646.79 somehow manage that in a way that you\n2651.8 know that allows you to have the cash\n2656.92 eventually to pay people when they leave\n2664.03 and and and that's where really the\n2667.1 biggest rewards are I mean when you have\n2668.84 people who are leaving with the you know\n2672.079 I want to have a million dollars you\n2675.589 look at some of the employees of SRC who\n2677.93 would you know line workers they come\n2681.109 out and they start businesses they've\n2683.119 learned how to run the company through\n2684.65 SRC and they and they start businesses\n2687.2 and then they wind up making more money\n2689.719 doing that and they did when they work\n2691.849 to SOC so these advantages are somewhat\n2696.769 known to me but I'd really appreciate it\n2698.599 if you would tell me that founders who\n2700.88 end up leaving companies with employee\n2704.15 ownership end up happier could you just\n2707.119 tell me well like one of those small\n2711.68 giants was a company called echo echo\n2716.269 was the backup alarm company you know\n2719.769 eep-eep eep-eep eep-eep\n2722.18 there was actually one company that sort\n2724.999 of dominated the market in backup alarms\n2729.349 it's located in Boise Idaho it's\n2731.989 employee owned company called it was an\n2734.93 employee owned company called echo and\n2738.459 it they not only did backup along they\n2742.519 did like amber warning lights and things\n2744.499 like that as well it was a very\n2746.359 successful company and they were also a\n2750.739 great game company and you know they\n2753.499 were I think something like 57% him the\n2758.509 the ESOP I think owned something like 57\n2761.989 or 60 percent of the company with with\n2765.89 the rest owned by the individual\n2768.769 shareholders and they I write about this\n2775.009 and finish big I also actually write\n2778.729 about it in the 10th anniversary edition\n2780.92 of small giants nice to have that\n2785.42 overlap you know\n2787.279 makes the writing a lot easier they they\n2795.619 got into a situation where it's again\n2799.4 back in 2006 2007 when one of the things\n2805.009 if you have an esop is he required by\n2807.109 law to have evaluation done you know for\n2812.239 the IRS basically every year and in 2006\n2818.239 or 2007 did the idea that they wanted to\n2821.419 go out and buy another company so the\n2823.789 CEO went out did his investigations into\n2829.489 buying this company they didn't wind up\n2831.829 buying the company but one thing he\n2833.929 discovered was that the market value of\n2836.959 echo was two or three times what the\n2842.439 assessed value was now what that means\n2845.809 is that if he could do a deal\n2848.109 he sort of he had a fiduciary\n2850.309 responsibility to all the employees and\n2854.359 if he could do a deal that would mean\n2857.539 that they would get back in 2006 an\n2862.519 amount of money that they probably\n2867.769 wouldn't ever they wouldn't get for\n2869.359 another ten years or more and that's\n2873.319 assuming that nothing bad happened in\n2875.509 the meantime and of course back in 2006\n2879.109 something bad was looming on the horizon\n2882.069 and so he felt that he had to go ahead\n2887.9 with this and it was touch-and-go for a\n2890.39 while because there were private equity\n2892.759 firms he was afraid that they'd get a\n2896.15 private equity he'd seen private equity\n2898.309 firms and to come into the industry and\n2902.14 they wound up laying off lots and lots\n2905.509 of people and you know building up their\n2908.659 margins just so they could sell later to\n2912.289 another private equity company\n2914.14 they get batted around it said it was it\n2917.529 can be I'm not saying it always is but\n2920.2 it can be a terrible situation for them\n2924.15 and fortunately there was one other\n2927.609 company that was not a private equity\n2930.339 firm but was what's called a family\n2932.23 office which in Philadelphia that was\n2936.96 basically the wealth of one family that\n2939.91 had been invested wisely and they built\n2944.26 a company around it called Berwyn and so\n2949.869 he felt he said well you know I don't\n2952.69 really need to do a deal at all\n2954.369 and if if if we're going to be bought by\n2960.029 somebody who is going to you know sort\n2966.88 of rate the company I can always call it\n2970.96 over I can always back out of it well\n2973.269 yes and no turns out that he had to hire\n2977.529 somebody\n2978.339 it was obligated to hire somebody to\n2984.42 serve as his ethics advisor in terms of\n2989.14 what he couldn't couldn't do and the\n2992.47 ethics advisor informed him that he had\n2995.799 to accept the highest offer no matter\n2998.74 what and he said wait wait you mean you\n3002.25 mean if the highest offer comes from\n3003.809 somebody who's going to everybody's\n3006.93 gonna lose their jobs I have to accept\n3010.259 that he said yep you've got to accept\n3011.97 that that's that's your responsibility\n3014.67 it's your responsibility if you want to\n3016.71 avoid losses note to self\n3019.14 thank you\n3020.8 and he got lucky because rwanda actually\n3026.23 did come in they did the by far the best\n3029.23 job of investigating the company and\n3032.04 they wound up with the highest offer and\n3035.109 it was you know they were valued the\n3037.45 assessed value was about a hundred\n3039.19 dollars this year they went up selling\n3041.56 for something like spend $40 this year\n3043.96 which where the employees was pretty\n3048.19 good deal and he was happy afterwards so\n3052.599 I've got one more question yeah I think\n3056.05 that your your seventh bit of advice\n3058.69 which is knowing what comes next\n3061.599 yeah that's I think about that is being\n3063.43 pulled out by something new rather than\n3066.609 merely stopping something you've done\n3068.68 for years well and I'd love you to talk\n3071.5 more about that yeah well it's very\n3072.97 difficult as you can imagine it would be\n3078.49 very difficult for me when you're\n3080.349 engaged in something that you enjoy\n3082.57 doing to imagine what life is going to\n3087.58 be like afterwards it really involves\n3090.82 visioning which is the speciality of\n3096.25 Zingerman's and it's still very hard and\n3104.609 you know think about it I was one guy\n3108.94 who I talked to\n3110.08 took him 11 years to get to the point\n3113.74 where it wasn't depressed any morning\n3115.48 actually it's something else he was\n3116.83 doing and you think about it you know\n3122.64 people say a lot of people were saying\n3126.04 to me the worst question they could get\n3128.05 after they sold their company was what\n3130.48 do you do you know they go to a party\n3134.02 and somebody says well what do you do\n3135.28 and they wouldn't know how to answer it\n3137.77 didn't want to say well I used to own a\n3139.869 company and then the next question is\n3142.93 well what do you do now\n3145.8 and it was very so that they lose that\n3151.89 sense of identity they lose the sense of\n3154.83 purpose\n3156.45 you know they lose their tribe they\n3159.24 people they've been hanging out with for\n3161.31 years they lose the structure that comes\n3165.96 from business business is great because\n3167.67 it tells you what you need to do next\n3170.27 and the losses sort of the sense of\n3174.21 accomplishment\n3175.32 another thing about business it's great\n3177.21 is that it tells you how you're doing\n3179.15 and it tells you what you're\n3181.05 accomplishing suddenly you don't have\n3184.08 any of that and people feel lost that's\n3189.45 what they all say they feel lost it's\n3192.15 like and they're asking themselves you\n3194.94 know who am i what am i doing was I\n3200.15 where do I go from here and that can be\n3203.75 profoundly depressing I thought about it\n3210.93 and it was interesting because when I\n3213.15 looked at the people who'd had good\n3214.89 exits they often went through a rocky\n3218.52 period at the beginning but eventually\n3221.66 what they wound up doing a huge number\n3227.1 of them was helping other entrepreneurs\n3232.55 basically going into a business where\n3235.77 they get paid to help entrepreneurs go\n3240.12 through this process or go through\n3242.01 building their companies I mean no\n3244.14 broadsky he probably spends 30 or 40\n3247.77 percent of his time just helping people\n3250.85 who come to him for a business advice\n3253.59 and then of course he and I did the\n3256.53 column in ink still and you know that\n3261.93 was true of lots of people like I go and\n3265.8 talk about finish big to various\n3269.91 organizations of people who are helping\n3273.75 other people you know whose job it is is\n3277.57 help business owners go through the\n3279.64 process of leaving their companies and I\n3282.13 was asked the people in the audience how\n3284.65 many of you are former business owners\n3286.33 and their hands you know three three\n3288.64 fourths of it people's hands go up\n3291.31 because it's something and you know when\n3293.77 I thought about it what are they doing\n3296.83 they're serving and I thought you know\n3300.57 what we say purposeful what are we\n3303.58 talking about we're really talking about\n3306.55 who are you serving you know and in\n3310.99 business at the very least you're gonna\n3314.56 be you're probably serving your family\n3317.53 you're gonna be serving your customers\n3319.6 if you aren't serving your customers\n3321.55 you're not gonna be in business very\n3322.66 long a lot of people they're serving\n3325.33 their employees as well for a lot as\n3329.14 well and here's a atomic offerings of\n3332.86 serving their community and that really\n3340.29 the thing that people lose is that at\n3346.12 least a lot of people I can't say\n3347.74 everybody because I didn't interview\n3349.6 everybody but for a lot of people what\n3352.45 they're losing is that sense of service\n3355.06 of who they're serving they're just out\n3357.4 there and it's like wait a minute what\n3359.26 am i doing Who am I\n3361.3 and I think that that's really critical\n3366.57 for people to think about beforehand you\n3370.27 know it's true that some people can go\n3373.93 and get involved in really big-time\n3376.54 charity work and that sort of thing but\n3379.36 I found that for a lot of people Bruce\n3383.04 leach for example he did an awful lot of\n3386.62 stuff all over the world for charity\n3389.71 stuff and he gave a lot of money away\n3391.81 and that sort of thing but there was\n3394.0 something missing for him there's\n3396.46 something about you know you're an\n3398.26 entrepreneur you're in business and\n3401.19 there's something about that that gives\n3405.16 you a sense of fulfillment\n3408.09 you know you can look at your charity\n3410.91 work and say well I'm proud I did this\n3413.46 and it was a good thing for me to do but\n3415.98 there's something missing from it for a\n3418.35 lot of people I'm not saying for\n3419.85 everybody because they can't I don't\n3421.53 know everybody but that's what I found\n3423.66 with a lot of the people oh thank you so\n3427.35 much for writing small giants and\n3428.82 inspiring us at atomic and then for\n3430.92 finish big for inspiring me personally\n3432.63 thanks very much\n3434.92 [Applause]"}
